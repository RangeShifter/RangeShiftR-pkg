  {"id":"abenSimpleIndividualbasedModels2014","abstract":"Reliable estimates of dispersal rates between habitat patches (i.e. functional connectivity) are critical for predicting long-term effects of habitat fragmentation on population persistence. Connectivity measures are frequently derived from least cost path or graph-based approaches, despite the fact that these methods make biologically unrealistic assumptions. Individual-based models (IBMs) have been proposed as an alternative as they allow modelling movement behaviour in response to landscape resistance. However, IBMs typically require excessive data to be useful for management. Here, we test the extent to which an IBM requiring only an uncomplicated set of movement rules [the ‘stochastic movement simulator’ (SMS)] can predict animal movement behaviour in real-world landscapes. Movement behaviour of two forest birds, the Cabanis's greenbul Phyllastrephus cabanisi (a forest specialist) and the white-starred robin Pogonocichla stellata (a habitat generalist), across an Afrotropical matrix was simulated using SMS. Predictions from SMS were evaluated against a set of detailed movement paths collected by radiotracking homing individuals. SMS was capable of generating credible predictions of bird movement, although simulations were sensitive to the cost values and the movement rules specified. Model performance was generally highest when movement was simulated across low-contrasting cost surfaces and when virtual individuals were assigned low directional persistence and limited perceptual range. SMS better predicted movements of the habitat specialist than the habitat generalist, which highlights its potential to model functional connectivity when species movements are affected by the matrix. Synthesis and applications. Modelling the dispersal process with greater biological realism is likely to be critical for improving our predictive capability regarding functional connectivity and population persistence. For more realistic models to be widely applied, it is vital that their application is not overly complicated or data demanding. Here, we show that given relatively basic understanding of a species' dispersal ecology, the stochastic movement simulator represents a promising tool for estimating connectivity, which can help improve the design of functional ecological networks aimed at successful species conservation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Aben","given":"Job"},{"family":"Strubbe","given":"Diederik"},{"family":"Adriaensen","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Palmer","given":"Stephen C.

  {"id":"adriaensenApplicationLeastcostModelling2003","abstract":"The growing awareness of the adverse effects of habitat fragmentation on natural systems has resulted in a rapidly increasing number of actions to reduce current fragmentation of natural systems as well as a growing demand for tools to predict and evaluate the effect of changes in the landscape on connectivity in the natural world. Recent studies used ‘least-cost’ modelling (available as a toolbox in GIS-systems) to calculate ‘effective distance’, a measure for distance modified with the cost to move between habitat patches based on detailed geographical information on the landscape as well as behavioural aspects of the organisms studied. We applied the method to a virtual landscape and a small scaled agricultural system subject to different scenarios in a land re-allotment project. We discuss the importance of technical aspects and ecological assumption underlying this modelling method. The model is shown to be a flexible tool to model functional connectivity in the study of the relation between landscape and mobility of organisms as well as in scenario building and evaluation in wild life protection projects and applied land management projects. Since ‘effective distance’ has the same units as Euclidean distance (m), this effective distance may be a straightforward way to include landscape and behavioural aspects in other models which include distance as a measure for isolation. We show the importance of the ‘ecological’ quality of the input maps and the choice of relevant landscape features and resistance values.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Adriaensen","given":"F."},{"family":"Chardon","given":"J.

  {"id":"altweggDensitydependentDispersalSpeed2013","abstract":"Aim The speed of range expansions, be it invasive species colonizing a new area or species tracking a moving climatic niche, critically depends on dispersal. Models for species' range expansions generally assume dispersal to be independent of local population densities. However, animals often disperse in response to high population size or alternatively may avoid or leave areas of very low population sizes. We explore whether such density dependence in dispersal can safely be ignored when predicting the speed of range expansions. Location Simulation study. Methods We use simulations to examine the effect of different forms of density dependence in emigration and immigration on the speed of range expansions. For emigration, we consider linear and nonlinear forms of positive density dependence, negative density dependence at low population densities and constant emigration rates. For immigration, we consider options where individuals avoid crowded patches, are attracted to the presence of conspecifics or settle independent of local density. Results The speed of range expansion was slowest when emigration was strongly positively related to density (higher emigration at higher densities) and when individuals avoided settling in low-density patches. It tended to be fastest under negatively density-dependent emigration (higher emigration at lower densities). These results were consistent across two different life histories and different levels of carrying capacity. Main conclusions Our results suggest that considering density-dependent dispersal and the mechanisms leading to it are important for correctly predicting species' rates of spread. Organisms with a tendency to aggregate, for example, by relying on conspecific attraction in settlement and emigrating mainly in response to high local densities, are predicted to be least likely to expand their ranges and most at risk from spatial shifts in their climatic niches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Altwegg","given":"Res"},{"family":"Collingham","given":"Yvonne C."},{"family":"Erni","given":"Birgit"},{"family":"Huntley","given":"Brian"}],"container-title":"Diversity and Distributions","DOI":"10.1111/j.1472-4642.2012.00943.x","ISSN":"1472-4642","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2012.00943.x","page":"60-68","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Density-dependent dispersal and the speed of range expansions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2012.00943.x","volume":"19"},

Predictions of species' responses to climate change, incorporating metapopulation dynamics and elements of dispersal, allow us to explore the range margin dynamics for two lagomorphs of conservation concern. Although the lagomorphs have very different distribution patterns, shifts at the edge of the range were more pronounced than shifts in the overall metapopulation. For Romerolagus diazi (volcano rabbit), the lower elevation range limit shifted upslope by approximately 700 m. This reduced the area occupied by the metapopulation, as the mountain peak currently lacks suitable vegetation. For Lepus timidus (European mountain hare), we modelled the British metapopulation. Increasing the dispersive estimate caused the metapopulation to shift faster on the northern range margin (leading edge). By contrast, it caused the metapopulation to respond to climate change slower, rather than faster, on the southern range margin (trailing edge). The differential responses of the leading and trailing range margins and the relative sensitivity of range limits to climate change compared with that of the metapopulation centroid have important implications for where conservation monitoring should be targeted.

I examine the consequences for dispersal evolution of the responsiveness of dispersal to the environment, the accuracy of any proximal cues that individuals rely upon to assess habitat quality, and whether dispersal responds to fitness itself or only to some fitness components (juvenile survivorship). All of the conditional dispersal behaviors that I consider weaken the indirect cost of dispersal inhibiting local adaptation. However, if individuals rely on imprecise cues to assess habitat quality and base dispersal decisions on juvenile survivorship, then conditional dispersal can incur additional costs by exacerbating overcrowding.

A well developed range of statistical methods currently exists that projects the possible future habitat of a species directly from the current climate and a species distribution. However, studies incorporating ecological and evolutionary processes remain limited. Here, we focus on the potential role that local adaptation to climate may play in driving the range dynamics of sessile organisms. Incorporating environmental adaptation into a stochastic simulation yields several new insights. Counter-intuitively, our simulation results suggest that species with broader ranges are not necessarily more robust to climate change. Instead, species with broader ranges can be more susceptible to extinction as locally adapted genotypes are often blocked from range shifting by the presence of cooler adapted genotypes that persist even when their optimum climate has left them behind. Interestingly, our results also suggest that it will not always be the cold-adapted phenotypes that drive polewards range expansion. Instead, range shifts may be driven by phenotypes conferring adaptation to conditions prevalent towards the centre of a species’ equilibrium distribution. This may have important consequences for the conservation method termed predictive provenancing. These initial results highlight the potential importance of local adaptation in determining how species will respond to climate change and we argue that this is an area requiring urgent theoretical and empirical attention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Atkins","given":"K.

  {"id":"baguetteIndividualDispersalLandscape2013","abstract":"Connectivity is classically considered an emergent property of landscapes encapsulating individuals' flows across space. However, its operational use requires a precise understanding of why and how organisms disperse. Such movements, and hence landscape connectivity, will obviously vary according to both organism properties and landscape features. We review whether landscape connectivity estimates could gain in both precision and generality by incorporating three fundamental outcomes of dispersal theory. Firstly, dispersal is a multi-causal process; its restriction to an ‘escape reaction’ to environmental unsuitability is an oversimplification, as dispersing individuals can leave excellent quality habitat patches or stay in poor-quality habitats according to the relative costs and benefits of dispersal and philopatry. Secondly, species, populations and individuals do not always react similarly to those cues that trigger dispersal, which sometimes results in contrasting dispersal strategies. Finally, dispersal is a major component of fitness and is thus under strong selective pressures, which could generate rapid adaptations of dispersal strategies. Such evolutionary responses will entail spatiotemporal variation in landscape connectivity. We thus strongly recommend the use of genetic tools to: (i) assess gene flow intensity and direction among populations in a given landscape; and (ii) accurately estimate landscape features impacting gene flow, and hence landscape connectivity. Such approaches will provide the basic data for planning corridors or stepping stones aiming at (re)connecting local populations of a given species in a given landscape. This strategy is clearly species- and landscape-specific. But we suggest that the ecological network in a given landscape could be designed by stacking up such linkages designed for several species living in different ecosystems. This procedure relies on the use of umbrella species that are representative of other species living in the same ecosystem.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Baguette","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Blanchet","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Legrand","given":"Delphine"},{"family":"Stevens","given":"Virginie M."},{"family":"Turlure","given":"Camille"}],"container-title":"Biological Reviews","DOI":"10.1111/brv.12000","ISSN":"1469-185X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/brv.12000","page":"310-326","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Individual dispersal, landscape connectivity and ecological networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/brv.12000","volume":"88"},

Here we argue that dispersal behavior changes with landscape configuration stressing the evolutionary dimension that has often been ignored in landscape ecology. Our working hypothesis is that the functional grain of resource patches in the landscape is a crucial factor shaping individual movements, and therefore influencing landscape connectivity. Such changes are likely to occur on the short-term (some generations). We review empirical studies comparing dispersal behavior in landscapes differing in their fragmentation level, i.e., with variable resource grain. We show that behavioral variation affecting each of the three stages of the dispersal process (emigration, displacement or transfer in the matrix, and immigration) is indeed likely to occur according to selective pressures resulting from changes in the grain of the landscape (mortality or deferred costs). Accordingly, landscape connectivity results from the interaction between the dispersal behavior of individuals and the grain of each particular landscape. The existence of this interaction requires that connectivity estimates (being based on individual-based models, least cost distance algorithms, and structural connectivity metrics or even Euclidian distance) should be carefully evaluated for their applicability with respect to the required level of precision in species-specific and landscape information.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Baguette","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Van Dyck","given":"Hans"}],"container-title":"Landscape Ecology","container-title-short":"Landscape Ecol","DOI":"10.1007/s10980-007-9108-4","ISSN":"1572-9761","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1117-1129","source":"Springer Link","title":"Landscape connectivity and animal behavior: functional grain as a key determinant for dispersal","title-short":"Landscape connectivity and animal behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-007-9108-4","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"bakerIncrementalCostsBenefits2004","abstract":"Incremental (distance-dependent) costs and benefits of dispersal have received less attention than those that are qualitative. We present a dynamic programming model of settling behavior using parameters estimated from a field study of dispersal in desert isopods, Hemilepistus reaumuri, which walk up to thousands of meters before settling in new or already-established burrows each spring. The model shows that incremental costs of dispersal lead to right-skewed population dispersal patterns, in contrast to cost-free systems or those with unitary costs (i.e., a one time cost of leaving a group or patch). In the model, continuous variation in habitat quality, as opposed to discrete suitable vs. unsuitable sites, allows for trade-offs with dispersal costs that lead to shifts in the likelihood of settling in a patch of a given quality. Thus, measurement of quantitative costs and benefits of movement are needed to understand population dispersal distributions. These costs or benefits may be observable during or after movement, and we examined both pre- and postsettling incremental consequences of dispersal. The daily mortality rate of traveling isopods was 4.2% during the dispersal season, higher than that of settled individuals. Successful settlers traveled more slowly, but burrows started in midseason were most likely to succeed. More distant burrows failed more often, suggesting either an additional cost of movement or a difference in the quality of individuals traveling different distances. The predicted mean dispersal duration from the simulations matched observed values closely, but was based on an unrealistic assumption of perfect knowledge of habitat quality, suggesting some other factor favors longer times before settling. Reproductive success was much higher in re-used burrows than in new burrows, making them a possible incentive for long-distance movements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Baker","given":"Mitchell B."},{"family":"Rao","given":"Steven"}],"container-title":"Ecology","ISSN":"0012-9658","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"page":"1039-1051","publisher":"Ecological Society of America","source":"JSTOR","title":"Incremental Costs and Benefits Shape Natal Dispersal: Theory and Example with Hemilepistus reaumuri","title-short":"Incremental Costs and Benefits Shape Natal Dispersal","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3450319","volume":"85"},

  {"id":"bartonEvolutionIntelligentDispersal2009","abstract":"Theoretical work exploring dispersal evolution focuses on the emigration rate of individuals and typically assumes that movement occurs either at random to any other patch or to one of the nearest-neighbour patches. There is a lack of work exploring the process by which individuals move between patches, and how this process evolves. This is of concern because any organism that can exert control over dispersal direction can potentially evolve efficiencies in locating patches, and the process by which individuals find new patches will potentially have major effects on metapopulation dynamics and gene flow. Here, we take an initial step towards filling this knowledge gap. To do this we constructed a continuous space population model, in which individuals each carry heritable trait values that specify the characteristics of the biased correlated random walk they use to disperse from their natal patch. We explore how the evolution of the random walk depends upon the cost of dispersal, the density of patches in the landscape, and the emigration rate. The clearest result is that highly correlated walks always evolved (individuals tended to disperse in relatively straight lines from their natal patch), reflecting the efficiency of straight-line movement. In our models, more costly dispersal resulted in walks with higher correlation between successive steps. However, the exact walk that evolved also depended upon the density of suitable habitat patches, with low density habitat evolving more biased walks (individuals which orient towards suitable habitat at quite large distances from that habitat). Thus, low density habitat will tend to develop individuals which disperse efficiently between adjacent habitat patches but which only rarely disperse to more distant patches; a result that has clear implications for metapopulation theory. Hence, an understanding of the movement behaviour of dispersing individuals is critical for robust long-term predictions of population dynamics in fragmented landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Bartoń","given":"Kamil A."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Ben L."},{"family":"Morales","given":"Juan M."},{"family":"Travis","given":"Justin M.

Here, we develop a simple model that links inter-patch movement behaviour with population dynamics in order to explore how individual dispersal behaviour influences not only its dispersal and survival, but also the population's rate of range expansion. Whereas dispersers are most likely to survive when they follow nearly straight lines and rapidly orient movement towards a non-natal patch, the most rapid rates of range expansion are obtained for trajectories in which individuals delay biasing their movement towards a non-natal patch. This result is robust to the spatial structure of the landscape. Importantly, in a set of evolutionary simulations, we also demonstrate that the movement strategy that evolves at an expanding front is much closer to that maximizing the rate of range expansion than that which maximizes the survival of dispersers. Our results suggest that if one of our conservation goals is the facilitation of range-shifting, then current indices of connectivity need to be complemented by the development and utilization of new indices providing a measure of the ease with which a species spreads across a landscape.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Bartoń","given":"K.

In this review, we first examine the different possible effects of climate change that can operate at individual, population, species, community, ecosystem and biome scales, notably showing that species can respond to climate change challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three non-exclusive axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g. range) and self (e.g. physiology). Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and sub-continental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered.

  {"id":"bessa-gomesDiscreteTwosexModels2010","abstract":"Although sexual reproduction has long been a central subject of theoretical ecology, until recently its consequences for population dynamics were largely overlooked. This is now changing, and many studies have addressed this issue, showing that when the mating system is taken into account, the population dynamics depends on the relative abundance of males and females, and is non-linear. Moreover, sexual reproduction increases the extinction risk, namely due to the Allee effect. Nevertheless, different studies have identified diverse potential consequences, depending on the choice of mating function. In this study, we investigate the consequences of three alternative mating functions that are frequently used in discrete population models: the minimum; the harmonic mean; and the modified harmonic mean. We consider their consequences at three levels: on the probability that females will breed; on the presence and intensity of the Allee effect; and on the extinction risk. When we consider the harmonic mean, the number of times the individuals of the least abundant sex mate exceeds their mating potential, which implies that with variable sex-ratios the potential reproductive rate is no longer under the modeller's control. Consequently, the female breeding probability exceeds 1 whenever the sex-ratio is male-biased, which constitutes an obvious problem. The use of the harmonic mean is thus only justified if we think that this parameter should be re-defined in order to represent the females' breeding rate and the fact that females may reproduce more than once per breeding season. This phenomenon buffers the Allee effect, and reduces the extinction risk. However, when we consider birth-pulse populations, such a phenomenon is implausible because the number of times females can reproduce per birth season is limited. In general, the minimum or modified harmonic mean mating functions seem to be more suitable for assessing the impact of mating systems on population dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Bessa-Gomes","given":"Carmen"},{"family":"Legendre","given":"Stéphane"},{"family":"Clobert","given":"Jean"}],"container-title":"Acta Oecologica","DOI":"10.1016/j.actao.2010.02.010","ISSN":"1146-609X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,9,1]]},"page":"439-445","source":"NASA ADS","title":"Discrete two-sex models of population dynamics: On modelling the mating function","title-short":"Discrete two-sex models of population dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AcO....36..439B","volume":"36"},

Furthermore, a greater understanding of the spatial population dynamics underlying range shifting is required to complement the advances made in climate niche modelling. A simulation model is developed which incorporates three key features that have been largely overlooked in studies of range shifting dynamics: the form of intraspecific competition, density dependent dispersal and the transient dynamics of habitat patches. The results show that the exact shape of the response depends critically on both local and patch dynamics. Species whose intraspecific competition is contest based are more vulnerable than those whose competition is scramble based. Contesters are especially sensitive when combined with density dependent dispersal. Species living in patches whose carrying capacity grows slowly are also susceptible to rapid shifts of environmental conditions.

  {"id":"bianRepresentationEnvironmentContext2003","abstract":"Individual-based modeling includes the explicit representation of the environment, to which individual organisms interact. From the perspective of spatial representation, spatially extended environment is different from discrete individual organisms, thus the success of object-orientation in the representation of individual organisms may not be applicable to the representation of the environment. Over the past few years, the attempt to adopt object-orientation in the representation of the environment has stimulated interesting discussions over what space is and how it may be represented in ecological modeling. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the merit of two traditional approaches used to represent the environment, i.e., the grid model and the patch model, and, in particular, the object-oriented versions of the two approaches in the representation of the environment. Two case studies are provided in support of the discussions of how the environment may be represented. One case study concerns individual fish growth and movement in an aquatic environment and the other concerns the movement of calving elk in a short-grass prairie. The discussion stresses the importance of two issues in the context of individual-based modeling: (1) the distinction between object-orientation used as a programming technique and as a representation means, and (2) the conceptual compatibility between a perceived phenomenon and the approach used to represent the phenomenon. It is suggested that caution be exercised in the practice of treating cells as objects. The paper concludes that two approaches may be appropriate for individual-based modeling. One is a hybrid approach that incorporates the traditional grid model of the environment and an object-oriented model of individual organisms. The other is the all-object approach that combines the object-oriented patches of the environment and the object-oriented individual organisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Bian","given":"Ling"}],"container-title":"Ecological Modelling","container-title-short":"Ecological Modelling","DOI":"10.1016/S0304-3800(02)00298-3","ISSN":"0304-3800","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,1,15]]},"language":"en","page":"279-296","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The representation of the environment in the context of individual-based modeling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380002002983","volume":"159"},

To identify possible dynamics of species when including these factors, we ran simulations of two competing species using an individual-based, coupled map-lattice model using a linear climatic gradient that varies across latitude and is warmed over time. Reproductive success is governed by an individual's adaptation to local climate as well as its location relative to global constraints. In exploratory experiments varying the strength of adaptation and competition, competition reduces genetic diversity and slows range change, although the two species can coexist in the absence of climate change and shift in the absence of competitors. We also found that one species can drive the other to extinction, sometimes long after climate change ends. Weak selection on local adaptation and poor dispersal ability also caused surfing of cooler-adapted phenotypes from the expanding margin backwards, causing loss of warmer-adapted phenotypes. Finally, geographic ranges can become disjointed, losing centrally-adapted genotypes. These initial results suggest that the interplay between local adaptation and interspecific competition can significantly influence species' responses to climate change, in a way that demands future research.","author":[{"family":"Bocedi","given":"Greta"},{"family":"Atkins","given":"Katherine E."},{"family":"Liao","given":"Jishan"},{"family":"Henry","given":"Roslyn C."},{"family":"Travis","given":"Justin M.

Our findings show an interesting interplay between information use and the evolved emigration propensity. Lack of information led to higher emigration probabilities in more unpredictable environments but to lower emigration probabilities in constant or highly predictable scenarios. Somewhat-informed dispersal strategies were selected for in most cases, even when the acquisition of information was associated with a moderate reproductive cost. Notably, selection rarely favored investment in acquisition of high-precision information, and the tendency to invest in information acquisition was greatest in predictable environments when the associated cost was low.

During current range shifts, species are simultaneously confronted with a second major anthropogenic disturbance, landscape fragmentation. Using individual-based models with a shifting climate window, we examine the effect of different rates of climate change on the evolution of dispersal distances through changes in the genetically determined dispersal kernel. Our results demonstrate that the rate of climate change is positively correlated to the evolved dispersal distances although too fast climate change causes the population to crash. When faced with realistic rates of climate change, greater dispersal distances evolve than those required for the population to keep track of the climate, thereby maximizing population size. Importantly, the greater dispersal distances that evolve when climate change is more rapid, induce evolutionary rescue by facilitating the population in crossing large gaps in the landscape. This could ensure population persistence in case of range shifting in fragmented landscapes.

  {"id":"bonenfantChapterEmpiricalEvidence2009","abstract":"Density‐dependence is a key concept in population dynamics. Here, we review how body mass and demographic parameters vary with population density in large herbivores. The demographic parameters we consider are age‐ and sex‐specific reproduction, survival and dispersal. As population density increases, the body mass of large herbivores typically declines, affecting individual performance traits such as age of first reproduction and juvenile survival. We documented density‐dependent variations in reproductive rates for many species from the Arctic to subtropical zones, both with and without predation. At high density, a trade‐off between growth and reproduction delays the age of primiparity and often increases the costs of reproduction, decreasing both survival and future reproductive success of adult females. Density‐dependent preweaning juvenile survival occurs more often in polytocous than monotocous species, while the effects of density on post‐weaning juvenile survival are independent of litter size. Responses of adult survival to density are much less marked than for juvenile survival, and may be exaggerated by density‐dependent changes in age structure. The role of density‐dependent dispersal in population dynamics remains uncertain, because very few studies have examined it. For sexually dimorphic species, we found little support for higher sensitivity to increasing density in the life history traits of males compared to females, except for young age classes. It remains unclear whether males of dimorphic species are sensitive to male density, female density or a combination of both. Eberhardt's model predicting a sequential effect of density on demographic parameters (from juvenile survival to adult survival) was supported by 9 of 10 case studies. In addition, population density at birth can also lead to cohort effects, including a direct effect on juvenile survival and long‐term effects on average cohort performance as adults. Density effects typically interact with weather, increasing in strength in years of harsh weather. For some species, the synchronization between plant phenology and reproductive cycle is a key process in population dynamics. The timing of late gestation as a function of plant phenology determines whether density‐dependence influences juvenile survival or adult female reproduction. The detection of density‐dependence can be made difficult by nonlinear relationships with density, high sampling variability, lagged responses to density changes, changes in population age structure, and temporal variation in the main factors limiting population growth. The negative feedbacks of population size on individual performance, and hence on life history traits, are thus only expected in particular ecological contexts and are most often restricted to certain age‐specific demographic traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Bonenfant","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Gaillard","given":"Jean‐Michel"},{"family":"Coulson","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Festa‐Bianchet","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Loison","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Garel","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Loe","given":"Leif Egil"},{"family":"Blanchard","given":"Pierrick"},{"family":"Pettorelli","given":"Nathalie"},{"family":"Owen‐Smith","given":"Norman"},{"family":"Du Toit","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Duncan","given":"Patrick"}],"container-title":"Advances in Ecological Research","DOI":"10.1016/S0065-2504(09)00405-X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"313-357","publisher":"Academic Press","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Chapter 5 Empirical Evidence of Density‐Dependence in Populations of Large Herbivores","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S006525040900405X","volume":"41"},

They may equally be incurred during life stages before the actual dispersal event through investments in special morphologies. Because costs will eventually determine the performance of dispersing individuals and the evolution of dispersal, we here provide an extensive review on the different cost types that occur during dispersal in a wide array of organisms, ranging from micro-organisms to plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. In general, costs of transfer have been more widely documented in actively dispersing organisms, in contrast to a greater focus on costs during departure and settlement in plants and animals with a passive transfer phase. Costs related to the development of specific dispersal attributes appear to be much more prominent than previously accepted. Because costs induce trade-offs, they give rise to covariation between dispersal and other life-history traits at different scales of organismal organisation. The consequences of (i) the presence and magnitude of different costs during different phases of the dispersal process, and (ii) their internal organisation through covariation with other life-history traits, are synthesised with respect to potential consequences for species conservation and the need for development of a new generation of spatial simulation models.","author":[{"family":"Bonte","given":"D."},{"family":"Bullock","given":"James M."},{"family":"Coulon","given":"Aurélie"},{"family":"Delgado","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Gibbs","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Lehouck","given":"Valerie"},{"family":"Matthysen","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Mustin","given":"Karin"},{"family":"Saastamoinen","given":"Marjo"},{"family":"Schtickzelle","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Stevens","given":"Virginie M."},{"family":"Vandewoestijne","given":"Sofie"},{"family":"Baguette","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Barton","given":"Kamil"},{"family":"Benton","given":"Tim G."},{"family":"Chaput-Bardy","given":"Audrey"},{"family":"Clobert","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Dytham","given":"Calvin"},{"family":"Hovestadt","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Meier","given":"Christoph M."},{"family":"Palmer","given":"Steve C.

This variation is particularly ecological relevant if it encompasses a functional separation of short- (SDD) and long-distance dispersal (LDD). It remains, however, an open question whether both parts of the dispersal kernel are similarly affected by landscape related selection pressures. We implemented an individual-based model to analyze the evolution of dispersal traits in fractal landscapes that vary in the proportion of habitat and its spatial configuration. Individuals are parthenogenetic with dispersal distance determined by two alleles on each individual's genome: one allele coding for the probability of global dispersal and one allele coding for the variance σ of a Gaussian local dispersal with mean value zero. Simulations show that mean distances of local dispersal and the probability of global dispersal, increase with increasing habitat availability, but that changes in the habitat's spatial autocorrelation impose opposing selective pressure: local dispersal distances decrease and global dispersal probabilities increase with decreasing spatial autocorrelation of the available habitat. Local adaptation of local dispersal distance emerges in landscapes with less than 70% of clumped habitat. These results demonstrate that long and short distance dispersal evolve separately according to different properties of the landscape. The landscape structure may consequently largely affect the evolution of dispersal distance strategies and the level of dispersal polymorphism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Bonte","given":"Dries"},{"family":"Hovestadt","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Poethke","given":"Hans-Joachim"}],"container-title":"Oikos","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17943.x","ISSN":"1600-0706","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17943.x","page":"560-566","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Evolution of dispersal polymorphism and local adaptation of dispersal distance in spatially structured landscapes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17943.x","volume":"119"},

Empirical evidence, especially in organisms living in spatially structured populations, however, is scarce. We investigated the relation between habitat configuration (patch size, connectivity) and dispersal by studying variation in tiptoe behaviour in the dune wolf spider, Pardosa monticola, under standardized laboratory conditions. Tiptoe behaviour prepares spiderlings for ballooning and can hence be considered as a precursor of aerial dispersal. The proportion of individuals that displayed tiptoe behaviour was highest in offspring from grasslands in a large dune landscape where habitat was continuously available, intermediate in offspring originating from a fragmented landscape, and lowest in offspring originating from a small and extremely isolated grassland patch. At the level of the fragmented landscape, variation was related to size and connectivity of four subpopulations. Both between and within landscapes, maternal condition had no effect on offspring dispersal. These results indicate that changes in habitat configuration from a large, connected landscape towards a small, fragmented one may lead to a decrease in dispersal rates, even at small spatial scales. Hence, behavioural traits narrowly linked to dispersal evolve towards less mobile phenotypes in small, isolated habitats, indicating high dispersal costs and low efficacy for gene flow in a spider species restricted to fragmented habitats.","author":[{"family":"Bonte","given":"D."},{"family":"Borre","given":"J.

Because the resulting change in sex ratio is expected to affect the evolution of sex-specific dispersal, we investigated under which environmental conditions strong sex-biased dispersal would emerge, and how this would affect host and endosymbiont metapopulation persistence. Results: We simulated host-endosymbiont metapopulation dynamics in an individual-based model, in which dispersal rates are allowed to evolve independently for the two sexes. Prominent male-biased dispersal emerges under conditions of low environmental stochasticity and high dispersal mortality. By applying a reshuffling algorithm, we show that kin-competition is a major driver of this evolutionary pattern because of the high within-population relatedness of males compared to those of females. Moreover, the evolution of sex-specific dispersal rescues metapopulations from extinction by (i) reducing endosymbiont fixation rates and (ii) by enhancing the extinction of endosymbionts within metapopulations that are characterized by low environmental stochasticity. Conclusion: Male killing endosymbionts induce the evolution of sex-specific dispersal, with prominent male-biased dispersal under conditions of low environmental stochasticity and high dispersal mortality. This male-biased dispersal emerges from stronger kin-competition in males compared to females and induces an evolutionary rescue mechanism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Bonte","given":"Dries"},{"family":"Hovestadt","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Poethke","given":"Hans Joachim"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"eng","source":"opus.bibliothek.uni-wuerzburg.de","title":"Sex-specific dispersal and evolutionary rescue in metapopulations infected by male killing endosymbionts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://opus.bibliothek.uni-wuerzburg.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/3999"},

Despite the focus of much theoretical research, simplistic assumptions regarding the dispersal process are still made. Dispersal is usually regarded as an unconditional process although in many cases fitness gains of dispersal are dependent on environmental factors and individual state. Condition-dependent dispersal strategies will often be superior to unconditional, fixed strategies. In addition, dispersal is often collapsed into a single parameter, despite it being a process composed of three interdependent stages: emigration, inter-patch movement and immigration, each of which may display different condition dependencies. Empirical studies have investigated correlates of these stages, emigration in particular, providing evidence for the prevalence of conditional dispersal strategies. Ill-defined use of the term 'dispersal', for movement across many different spatial scales, further hinders making general conclusions and relating movement correlates to consequences at the population level. Logistical difficulties preclude a detailed study of dispersal for many species, however incorporating unrealistic dispersal assumptions in spatial population models may yield inaccurate and costly predictions. Further studies are necessary to explore the importance of incorporating specific condition-dependent dispersal strategies for evolutionary and population dynamic predictions.","author":[{"family":"Bowler","given":"Diana E."},{"family":"Benton","given":"Tim G."}],"container-title":"Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society","container-title-short":"Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc","DOI":"10.1017/s1464793104006645","ISSN":"1464-7931","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,5]]},"language":"eng","page":"205-225","PMID":"15921049","source":"PubMed","title":"Causes and consequences of animal dispersal strategies: relating individual behaviour to spatial dynamics","title-short":"Causes and consequences of animal dispersal strategies","type":"article-journal","volume":"80"},

Current reliance on bioclimatic envelope approaches ignores important biological processes such as interactions and dispersal. Although much debated, it is unclear how such processes might influence range shifting. Using individual-based modelling we show that interspecific interactions and dispersal ability interact with the rate of climate change to determine range-shifting dynamics in a simulated community with two growth forms--mutualists and competitors. Interactions determine spatial arrangements of species prior to the onset of rapid climate change. These lead to space-occupancy effects that limit the rate of expansion of the fast-growing competitors but which can be overcome by increased long-distance dispersal. As the rate of climate change increases, lower levels of long-distance dispersal can drive the mutualists to extinction, demonstrating the potential for subtle process balances, non-linear dynamics and abrupt changes from species coexistence to species loss during climate change.","author":[{"family":"Brooker","given":"Rob W."},{"family":"Travis","given":"Justin M.

We devised an experimental protocol to measure long-distance dispersal which involved measuring dispersal by wind from isolated individuals at a range of distances from the source, but maintaining a large and constant sampling intensity at each distance. Seeds were trapped up to 80 m from the plants, the furthest a dispersal curve for an individual plant has been measured for a non-tree species. Standard empirical negative exponential and inverse power models were fitted using likelihood methods. The latter always had a better fit than the former, but in most cases neither described the data well, and strongly under-estimated the tail of the dispersal curve. An alternative model formulation with two kernel components had a much better fit in most cases and described the tail data more accurately. Mechanistic models provide an alternative to direct measurement of dispersal. However, while a previous mechanistic model accurately predicted the modal dispersal distance, it always under-predicted the measured tail. Long-distance dispersal may be caused by rare extremes in horizontal wind speed or turbulence. Therefore, under-estimation of the tail by standard empirical models and mechanistic models may indicate a lack of flexibility to take account of such extremes. Future studies should examine carefully whether the widely used exponential and power models are, in fact, valid, and investigate alternative models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Bullock","given":"J.

The widespread occurrence of sexual dimorphism in life history traits and the occurrence of skewed and fluctuating sex ratios suggest that one-sex models or those dominated by one sex may often be less appropriate than two-sex models. Reproduction in two-sex models is a frequency-dependent nonlinear function (the birth or marriage function) of the relative abundance of males and females. In this paper, we examine the population dynamics resulting from three different two-sex, discrete-time, population-projection models. For a large class of birth functions, models without inter-stage mate competition are shown to converge to a locally stable adult sex ratio. Formulas for the stable population structure, stable sex ratio, and reproductive value at equilibrium are derived. When individuals of different stages compete for mates, the equilibrium population structure may become unstable. A sequence of bifurcations then occurs, leading to periodic oscillations, quasi-periodic fluctuations, and chaos as the intensity of competition increases. Finally, when per capita fecundity is a sigmoid function of the relative abundance of the other sex, perturbations of the sex ratio may lead to extinction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Caswell","given":"Hal"},{"family":"Weeks","given":"Daniel E."}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[1986]]},"page":"707-735","publisher":"[University of Chicago Press, American Society of Naturalists]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Two-Sex Models: Chaos, Extinction, and Other Dynamic Consequences of Sex","title-short":"Two-Sex Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2461952","volume":"128"},

Using a meta-analysis, we estimated that the distributions of species have recently shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0 meters per decade, and to higher latitudes at a median rate of 16.9 kilometers per decade. These rates are approximately two and three times faster than previously reported.

  {"id":"chipperfieldUpdatedAlgorithmGeneration2011","abstract":"Background Patterns that arise from an ecological process can be driven as much from the landscape over which the process is run as it is by some intrinsic properties of the process itself. The disentanglement of these effects is aided if it possible to run models of the process over artificial landscapes with controllable spatial properties. A number of different methods for the generation of so-called ‘neutral landscapes’ have been developed to provide just such a tool. Of these methods, a particular class that simulate fractional Brownian motion have shown particular promise. The existing methods of simulating fractional Brownian motion suffer from a number of problems however: they are often not easily generalisable to an arbitrary number of dimensions and produce outputs that can exhibit some undesirable artefacts. Methodology We describe here an updated algorithm for the generation of neutral landscapes by fractional Brownian motion that do not display such undesirable properties. Using Monte Carlo simulation we assess the anisotropic properties of landscapes generated using the new algorithm described in this paper and compare it against a popular benchmark algorithm. Conclusion/Significance The results show that the existing algorithm creates landscapes with values strongly correlated in the diagonal direction and that the new algorithm presented here corrects this artefact. A number of extensions of the algorithm described here are also highlighted: we describe how the algorithm can be employed to generate landscapes that display different properties in different dimensions and how they can be combined with an environmental gradient to produce landscapes that combine environmental variation at the local and macro scales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Chipperfield","given":"Joseph D."},{"family":"Dytham","given":"Calvin"},{"family":"Hovestadt","given":"Thomas"}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0017040","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,2,15]]},"language":"en","page":"e17040","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"An Updated Algorithm for the Generation of Neutral Landscapes by Spectral Synthesis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017040","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"clarkInvasionExtremesPopulation2001","abstract":"For populations having dispersal described by fat-tailed kernels (kernels with tails that are not exponentially bounded), asymptotic population spread rates cannot be estimated by traditional models because these models predict continually accelerating (asymptotically infinite) invasion. The impossible predictions come from the fact that the fat-tailed kernels fitted to dispersal data have a quality (nondiscrete individuals and, thus, no moment-generating function) that never applies to data. Real organisms produce finite (and random) numbers of offspring; thus, an empirical moment-generating function can always be determined. Using an alternative method to estimate spread rates in terms of extreme dispersal events, we show that finite estimates can be derived for fat-tailed kernels, and we demonstrate how variable reproduction modifies these rates. Whereas the traditional models define spread rate as the speed of an advancing front describing the expected density of individuals, our alternative definition for spread rate is the expected velocity for the location of the furthest-forward individual in the population. The asymptotic wave speed for a constant net reproductive rate R0 is approximated as (1/T)(piuR)/2)(1/2) m yr(-1), where T is generation time, and u is a distance parameter (m2) of Clark et al.'s 2Dt model having shape parameter p = 1. From fitted dispersal kernels with fat tails and infinite variance, we derive finite rates of spread and a simple method for numerical estimation. Fitted kernels, with infinite variance, yield distributions of rates of spread that are asymptotically normal and, thus, have finite moments. Variable reproduction can profoundly affect rates of spread. By incorporating the variance in reproduction that results from variable life span, we estimate much lower rates than predicted by the standard approach, which assumes a constant net reproductive rate. Using basic life-history data for trees, we show these estimated rates to be lower than expected from previous analytical models and as interpreted from paleorecords of forest spread at the end of the Pleistocene. Our results suggest reexamination of past rates of spread and the potential for future response to climate change.","author":[{"family":"Clark","given":"J.

  {"id":"clobertInformedDispersalHeterogeneity2009","abstract":"There is accumulating evidence that individuals leave their natal area and select a breeding habitat non-randomly by relying upon information about their natal and future breeding environments. This variation in dispersal is not only based on external information (condition dependence) but also depends upon the internal state of individuals (phenotype dependence). As a consequence, not all dispersers are of the same quality or search for the same habitats. In addition, the individual's state is characterized by morphological, physiological or behavioural attributes that might themselves serve as a cue altering the habitat choice of conspecifics. These combined effects of internal and external information have the potential to generate complex movement patterns and could influence population dynamics and colonization processes. Here, we highlight three particular processes that link condition-dependent dispersal, phenotype-dependent dispersal and habitat choice strategies: (1) the relationship between the cause of departure and the dispersers' phenotype; (2) the relationship between the cause of departure and the settlement behaviour and (3) the concept of informed dispersal, where individuals gather and transfer information before and during their movements through the landscape. We review the empirical evidence for these processes with a special emphasis on vertebrate and arthropod model systems, and present case studies that have quantified the impacts of these processes on spatially structured population dynamics. We also discuss recent literature providing strong evidence that individual variation in dispersal has an important impact on both reinforcement and colonization success and therefore must be taken into account when predicting ecological responses to global warming and habitat fragmentation.","author":[{"family":"Clobert","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Le Galliard","given":"Jean-François"},{"family":"Cote","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Meylan","given":"Sandrine"},{"family":"Massot","given":"Manuel"}],"container-title":"Ecology Letters","container-title-short":"Ecol Lett","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01267.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,3]]},"language":"eng","page":"197-209","PMID":"19170731","source":"PubMed","title":"Informed dispersal, heterogeneity in animal dispersal syndromes and the dynamics of spatially structured populations","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

Silk is an informative material about the presence of conspecifics. It can therefore inform on habitat suitability and hence assist in habitat choice. In this context, we investigated the influence of silk on microhabitat choice by the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae. Three factors that could potentially influence habitat choice were manipulated: the strain, number, and the stage of mites. Our study showed that these factors all influence the choice of microhabitat. The tendency of whether to settle on a silk-covered area was influenced by the origin of mites (strain effect). Adult females showed a higher tendency to settle on an area covered with the silk laid by numerous congeners (number effect). Moreover, larvae seemed to be more responsive to the presence of silk than adults (stage effect). This suggests that individuals use silk as a social cue in selecting their microhabitat and that the spatial organization and group behaviour seem to be shaped by the individuals’ response to social cues, such as the amount of silk already present.\nRésumé\nChez les arthropodes tisseurs, la soie peut être utilisée pour la construction, la protection et la communication.

Movement models can take many different forms, but the most widely used are based on the extensions of simple random walk processes. In this review paper, our aim is twofold: to introduce the mathematics behind random walks in a straightforward manner and to explain how such models can be used to aid our understanding of biological processes. We introduce the mathematical theory behind the simple random walk and explain how this relates to Brownian motion and diffusive processes in general. We demonstrate how these simple models can be extended to include drift and waiting times or be used to calculate first passage times. We discuss biased random walks and show how hyperbolic models can be used to generate correlated random walks. We cover two main applications of the random walk model. Firstly, we review models and results relating to the movement, dispersal and population redistribution of animals and micro-organisms. This includes direct calculation of mean squared displacement, mean dispersal distance, tortuosity measures, as well as possible limitations of these model approaches. Secondly, oriented movement and chemotaxis models are reviewed. General hyperbolic models based on the linear transport equation are introduced and we show how a reinforced random walk can be used to model movement where the individual changes its environment. We discuss the applications of these models in the context of cell migration leading to blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Finally, we discuss how the various random walk models and approaches are related and the connections that underpin many of the key processes involved.","author":[{"family":"Codling","given":"Edward A."},{"family":"Plank","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Benhamou","given":"Simon"}],"container-title":"Journal of the Royal Society, Interface","container-title-short":"J R Soc Interface","DOI":"10.1098/rsif.2008.0014","ISSN":"1742-5689","issue":"25","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,8,6]]},"language":"eng","page":"813-834","PMCID":"PMC2504494","PMID":"18426776","source":"PubMed","title":"Random walk models in biology","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

A relatively recent development is the combination of species distribution models, land-use change predictions, and dynamic population models to predict the relative and combined impacts of climate change, land-use change, and altered disturbance regimes on species' extinction risk. Each modelling component introduces its own source of uncertainty through different parameters and assumptions, which, when combined, can result in compounded uncertainty that can have major implications for management. Although some uncertainty analyses have been conducted separately on various model components - such as climate predictions, species distribution models, land-use change predictions, and population models - a unified sensitivity analysis comparing various sources of uncertainty in combined modelling approaches is needed to identify the most influential and problematic assumptions. We estimated the sensitivities of long-run population predictions to different ecological assumptions and parameter settings for a rare and endangered annual plant species (Acanthomintha ilicifolia, or San Diego thornmint).

We examine how density dependence and climate contribute to fluctuations in population size via age- and sex-specific demographic rates, and how fluctuations in demographic structure influence population dynamics. Density dependence contributes most, followed by climatic variation, age structure fluctuations and interactions between density and climate. We then simplify the density-dependent, stochastic, age-structured demographic model and derive a new phenomenological time series which captures the dynamics better than previously selected functions.

  {"id":"deblockLocalGeneticAdaptation2013","abstract":"Temperature effects on predator-prey interactions are fundamental to better understand the effects of global warming. Previous studies never considered local adaptation of both predators and prey at different latitudes, and ignored the novel population combinations of the same predator-prey species system that may arise because of northward dispersal. We set up a common garden warming experiment to study predator-prey interactions between Ischnura elegans damselfly predators and Daphnia magna zooplankton prey from three source latitudes spanning >1500 km. Damselfly foraging rates showed thermal plasticity and strong latitudinal differences consistent with adaptation to local time constraints. Relative survival was higher at 24 °C than at 20 °C in southern Daphnia and higher at 20 °C than at 24 °C, in northern Daphnia indicating local thermal adaptation of the Daphnia prey. Yet, this thermal advantage disappeared when they were confronted with the damselfly predators of the same latitude, reflecting also a signal of local thermal adaptation in the damselfly predators.

We advocate the novel common garden experimental approach using predators and prey obtained from natural temperature gradients spanning the predicted temperature increase in the northern populations as a powerful approach to gain mechanistic insights into how community modules will be affected by global warming.

  {"id":"delattreDispersalMoodRevealed2010","abstract":"A comprehensive mechanistic approach to dispersal requires the translation of the whole mobility register of the target organism into movement rules that could subsequently be used to model its displacements. According to the optimality paradigm, this procedure implies a cost – benefi t analysis of mobility patterns taking into account not only movements, but also their external context and the internal state of the moving individuals. Using this framework, we detected a ‘dispersal mood' in some individuals of the meadow brown butterfly Maniola jurtina. These adopted a direct flight strategy, which was topologically different from the previously documented foray search strategy. Those individuals that used the direct flight strategy moved straighter as soon as they left the habitat and avoided heading back to their patch of origin, which is the best inter-patch search strategy when dispersal risks and costs are high. The direct flight strategy was conditional to sex: females used it twice as much as males. We suggest that this sex bias was due to female investment in off spring, which is maximized by male avoidance and spatial bet hedging. Inter-patch dispersal of gravid females is crucial for the persistence of M. jurtina populations in spatially and temporally unpredictable environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Delattre","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Burel","given":"Francoise"},{"family":"Humeau","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Stevens","given":"Virginie Marie"},{"family":"Vernon","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Baguette","given":"Michel"}],"container-title":"Oikos","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0706.2010.18615.x","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"1900-1908","publisher":"Nordic Ecological Society","source":"HAL Archives Ouvertes","title":"Dispersal mood revealed by shifts from routine to direct flights in the meadow brown butterfly Maniola jurtina.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00557623","volume":"119"},

However, despite its importance, this complex ecological process still represents a significant gap in our understanding of animal ecology due to both the lack of empirical data and the intrinsic complexity of dispersal dynamics. 2. By studying natal dispersal of 74 radiotagged juvenile eagle owls Bubo bubo (Linnaeus), in both the wandering and the settlement phases, we empirically addressed the complex interactions by which individual phenotypic traits and external cues jointly shape individual heterogeneity through the different phases of dispersal, both at nightly and weekly temporal scales. 3. Owls in poorer physical conditions travelled shorter total distances during the wandering phase, describing straighter paths and moving slower, especially when crossing heterogeneous habitats. In general, the owls in worse condition started dispersal later and took longer times to find further settlement areas. Net distances were also sex biased, with females settling at further distances. Dispersing individuals did not seem to explore wandering and settlement areas by using a search image of their natal surroundings. Eagle owls showed a heterogeneous pattern of patch occupancy, where few patches were highly visited by different owls whereas the majority were visited by just one individual. During dispersal, the routes followed by owls were an intermediate solution between optimized and randomized ones. Finally, dispersal direction had a marked directionality, largely influenced by dominant winds. These results suggest an asymmetric and anisotropic dispersal pattern, where not only the number of patches but also their functions can affect population viability. 4. The combination of the information coming from the relationships among a large set of factors acting and integrating at different spatial and temporal scales, under the perspective of heterogeneous life histories, are a fruitful ground for future understanding of natal dispersal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Delgado","given":"María del Mar"},{"family":"Penteriani","given":"Vincenzo"},{"family":"Revilla","given":"Eloy"},{"family":"Nams","given":"Vilis O."}],"container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01655.x","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01655.x","page":"620-632","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The effect of phenotypic traits and external cues on natal dispersal movements","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01655.x","volume":"79"},

Density-dependent dispersal can be induced by local competition at different phases during development and/or by density-related sources of social information. Here, we assessed the importance of population density on emigration rates and the degree to which the presence of silk threads at dispersal takeoff locations affects immediate dispersal decision making in the spider Erigone atra. By quantifying behaviors in wind tunnels under standardized laboratory conditions, silk-assisted long- and short-distance dispersal is quantified before the actual onset of the dispersal event.Increased densities during juvenile development only affected short-distance dispersal behavior. In females, short-distance dispersal increased with the female density experienced during development, whereas responses in males increased under combined high male/low female-experienced densities. Elevated densities at the onset of dispersal led to a general increase of predispersal behaviors. The presence of silk threads at takeoff platforms similarly induced an increase of dispersal displays, with specifically an increase in long-distance dispersal in both sexes.Our results demonstrate that the spider E. atra uses information related to density during development, most probably to avoid competition by performing short-distance dispersal. In contrast, density-related cues at the time of dispersal (i.e., increased densities and the presence of silk threads) increase general dispersal activities and long-distance ballooning events. Short- and long-distance dispersal strategies are consequently guided by differential density-related information use.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"De Meester","given":"Nele"},{"family":"Bonte","given":"Dries"}],"container-title":"Behavioral Ecology","container-title-short":"Behavioral Ecology","DOI":"10.1093/beheco/arq088","ISSN":"1045-2249","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,9,1]]},"page":"992-998","source":"Silverchair","title":"Information use and density-dependent emigration in an agrobiont spider","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arq088","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"dennoHabitatPersistenceUnderlies1996","abstract":"Dispersal is considered a vital life history characteristic for insects exploiting temporary habitats, and life history theorists have often hypothesized an inverse relationship between dispersal capability and habitat persistence. Most often, this hypothesis has been tested using interspecific comparisons of dispersal capability and qualitative estimates of habitat persistence. Consequently, most assessments have failed to control for possible phylogenetic nonindependence and they also lack quantitative rigor. We capitalized on existing intraspecific variation in the dispersal capability of Prokelisia planthoppers to examine the relationship between habitat persistence and dispersal, thereby minimizing possible phylogenetic effects. Two congeneric species (Prokelisia marginata and P. dolus) occur in the intertidal marshes of North America, where they feed exclusively on cordgrasses (Spartina). Because these planthoppers exhibit wing dimorphism, flight-capable adults (macropters with fully developed wings) are easily differentiated from flightless adults (brachypters with reduced wings). Thus, dispersal capability can be readily estimated by the percentage of macropters in a population. At a regional spatial scale, we found a highly significant negative relationship between dispersal capability (percent macroptery) and habitat persistence. In this system, habitat persistence is influenced by a combination of marsh elevation, winter severity, and tidal range, which interact to determine the ability of planthoppers to endure through winter in their primary habitat for development. P. marginata develops primarily in low-marsh habitats during summer, habitats that can be subjected to pronounced winter disturbance due to ice scouring and/or extensive tidal inundation. Levels of winter disturbance of the low marsh are extreme along the Atlantic coast, intermediate along the Pacific, and low along the Gulf. Both the failure of P. marginata populations to remain through winter in this habitat, and the dispersal ability of these populations (92%, 29%, and 17% macroptery, respectively), are correlated with levels of disturbance. Thus, in regions where winter disturbance is high, levels of dispersal are correspondingly high to allow for recolonization of extirpated habitats from overwintering sites on the high marsh. Unlike P. marginata, P. dolus develops primarily in high-marsh habitats, which are much less disturbed on all coasts during winter. Consequently, this species remains year-round in its primary habitat for development, and most populations exhibit relatively low levels of macroptery (<10%). When raised under common garden conditions, many more macropters of both species were produced from Atlantic compared to Gulf populations. Thus the proportion of macropters produced from the populations used in this experiment paralleled the incidence of macroptery measured in the field, providing evidence that the geographic variation in dispersal capability in both species has in part a genetic basis. The results of this study provide strong intraspecific evidence for an inverse relationship between the dispersal capability of insects and the persistence of their habitats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Denno","given":"Robert F."},{"family":"Roderick","given":"George K."},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Merrill A."},{"family":"Huberty","given":"Andrea F."},{"family":"Dobel","given":"Hartmut G."},{"family":"Eubanks","given":"Micky D."},{"family":"Losey","given":"John E."},{"family":"Langellotto","given":"Gail A."}],"container-title":"Ecological Monographs","DOI":"10.2307/2963487","ISSN":"0012-9615","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1996]]},"page":"389-408","publisher":"Ecological Society of America","source":"JSTOR","title":"Habitat Persistence Underlies Intraspecific Variation in the Dispersal Strategies of Planthoppers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2963487","volume":"66"},

Public information, i.e. local reproductive performance of conspecifics, is expected to be a highly valuable cue for breeding habitat selection. However, the access to this cue may be spatially and temporally constrained. When public information is unavailable, individuals may use other integrative cues, such as the local density of breeders. 2. Departure decisions of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) were shown previously to be related to both public information and breeding density, in a long-term correlative study of a fragmented population. Here, we tested whether flycatchers also use public information (number and condition of fledglings produced locally) and breeding density to make individual settlement decisions in the following year. 3. Immigration rates were computed to measure the degree of attractiveness of patches to new breeders. We investigated the relative influence of public information and breeding density on immigration rates of yearlings and older adults separately. The access to public information for settlement decisions may indeed be more limited for yearlings. 4. Immigration rate in a patch increased with mean fledgling number in the previous year for older adults but not for yearlings. Yearling immigration rate was correlated positively to mean fledgling condition when patch breeding density in the previous year was low, but negatively when density was high. 5. Immigration rates of both yearlings and older adults increased with breeding density in the previous year. Breeding density explained a larger part of the variance in immigration rate than patch reproductive success. 6. The proportion of yearlings among breeders decreased with increasing patch reproductive success and breeding density in the previous year, suggesting that local competition was high in attractive patches. 7. Our results thus suggest that public information is also used for immigration decisions. However, decisions of yearlings are more complex than those of older adults, due to their more limited access to public information and the higher impact of intraspecific competition. Conversely, all individuals seemed to cue on breeding density in a similar way. Density is correlated to patch reproductive success, and may be a more easily accessible cue.

In this review article, we contrast the extremes of the correlative–process spectrum of species distribution models with respect to core assumptions, model building and selection strategies, validation, uncertainties, common errors and the questions they are most suited to answer. The extremes of such approaches differ clearly in many aspects, such as model building approaches, parameter estimation strategies and transferability. However, they also share strengths and weaknesses. We show that claims of one approach being intrinsically superior to the other are misguided and that they ignore the process–correlation continuum as well as the domains of questions that each approach is addressing. Nonetheless, the application of process-based approaches to species distribution modelling lags far behind more correlative (process-implicit) methods and more research is required to explore their potential benefits. Critical issues for the employment of species distribution modelling approaches are given, together with a guideline for appropriate usage.

To restrict its effects, ecological networks such as the trans-European network NATURA2000 are being developed based on the assumption that structural connections between habitat fragments lead to increased exchange through dispersal and a higher viability of (meta)populations. However, there is a great need for techniques that translate these networks and/or structural characteristics of landscapes into functional connectivity for specific organisms. Least-cost analysis has the capacities to fulfill these needs, but has never been validated against actual observations of dispersal paths. Here we present a method to validate the results of a least-cost analysis by comparing realized movement paths of hedgehogs in unfamiliar areas, obtained by radiotracking, with statistics on landscape-wide distribution of cost values. The degree of correspondence between empirical dispersal paths and the output of a least-cost analysis can be visualized and quantified, and least-cost scenarios can be statistically compared. We show that hedgehogs moved along paths with significantly lower cost values than the average landscape, implying that they took better than random routes, but performance was relatively poor. We attribute this to the relatively generalistic habitat use of the model species and the rather homogeneous landscapes. We conclude that this approach can be useful for further validation of the least-cost model and allows a direct comparison of model performance among different taxa and/or landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Driezen","given":"Kassandra"},{"family":"Adriaensen","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Rondinini","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Doncaster","given":"C.

Because dispersal phenotypes are complex and often costly, it is unclear how highly dispersive phenotypes are maintained in a species to enable their rapid expression during periods of range expansion. Here I test the idea that metapopulation dynamics of local extinction and recolonization maintain distinct dispersal strategies outside the context of range expansion. Western bluebirds display distinct dispersal phenotypes where aggressive males are more dispersive than nonaggressive males, resulting in highly aggressive populations at the edge of their expanding range. I experimentally created new habitat interior to the range edge to show that, as on the range front, it was colonized solely by aggressive males. Moreover, fitness consequences of aggression depended on population age: aggressive males had high fitness when colonizing new populations, while nonaggressive males performed best in an older population. These results suggest that distinct dispersal strategies were maintained before range expansion as an adaptation for the continual recolonization of new habitat.

For example, a long-distance dispersal strategy suitable for continuous habitat at the range core might not be favoured at the margin, where the habitat is sparse. Using a spatially explicit, individual-based, evolutionary simulation model, the dispersal strategies of an organism that has only one dispersal event in its lifetime, such as a plant or sessile animal, are considered. Within the model, removing habitat, increasing habitat turnover, increasing the cost of dispersal, reducing habitat quality or altering vital rates imposes range limits. In most cases, there is a clear change in the dispersal strategies across the range, although increasing death rate towards the margin has little impact on evolved dispersal strategy across the range. Habitat turnover, reduced birth rate and reduced habitat quality all increase evolved dispersal distances at the margin, while increased cost of dispersal and reduced habitat density lead to lower evolved dispersal distances at the margins. As climate change shifts suitable habitat poleward, species ranges will also start to shift, and it will be the dispersal capabilities of marginal populations, rather than core populations, that will influence the rate of range shifting.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Dytham","given":"Calvin"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Biol Sci","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2008.1535","ISSN":"0962-8452","issue":"1661","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,4,22]]},"page":"1407-1413","PMCID":"PMC2677228","PMID":"19324810","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Evolved dispersal strategies at range margins","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2677228/","volume":"276"},

However, theoretical models suggest that ageing and programmed death can be adaptive. Travis J. M. J. suggested that if fecundity declines with age, a programmed age of death evolves through kin selection and that the nature of dispersal is crucial as it determines the degree of spatial structure and hence the strength of kin selection. Here, using a similar model, we consider the interplay between dispersal and age of death. We incorporate more realistic dispersal kernels and allow both dispersal and age of death to evolve. Our results show each trait can evolve in response to the other: earlier age of death evolves when individuals disperse less and greater dispersal distances evolve when individuals are programmed to die later. When we allow dispersal and age of death to evolve at the same time we typically find that dispersal evolves more rapidly, and that ageing then evolves in response to the new dispersal regime. The cost of dispersal is crucial in determining the evolution of both traits. We argue both that ageing is an overlooked ecological process, and that the field of gerontology could learn a lot from evolutionary ecology. We suggest that it is time to develop the field of ecological gerontology and we highlight a few areas where future work might be particularly rewarding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Dytham","given":"Calvin"},{"family":"Travis","given":"Justin M.

  {"id":"edelaarMatchingHabitatChoice2008","abstract":"Gene flow among populations is typically thought to be antagonistic to population differentiation and local adaptation. However, this assumes that dispersing individuals disperse randomly with respect to their ability to use the environment. Yet dispersing individuals often sample and compare environments and settle in those environments that best match their phenotype, causing directed gene flow, which can in fact promote population differentiation and adaptation. We refer to this process as “matching habitat choice.” Although this process has been acknowledged by several researchers, no synthesis or perspective on its potentially widespread importance exists. Here we synthesize empirical and theoretical studies, and offer a new perspective that matching habitat choice can have significant effects on important and controversial topics. We discuss the potential implications of matching habitat choice for the degree and rate of local adaptation, the evolution of niche width, adaptive peak shifts, speciation in the presence of gene flow, and on our view and interpretation of measures of natural selection. Because of its potential importance for such a wide range of topics, we call for heightened empirical and theoretical attention for this neglected dimension in evolutionary and ecological studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Edelaar","given":"Pim"},{"family":"Siepielski","given":"Adam M."},{"family":"Clobert","given":"Jean"}],"container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00459.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00459.x","page":"2462-2472","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Matching Habitat Choice Causes Directed Gene Flow: A Neglected Dimension in Evolution and Ecology","title-short":"Matching Habitat Choice Causes Directed Gene Flow","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00459.x","volume":"62"},

The ability to perceive and make use of information about the surrounding environment for dispersal decisions will also differ between organisms. To investigate the evolutionary consequences of such differences, we have used a simulation model with nearest-neighbour dispersal in a metapopulation to study how variation in the ability to obtain and make use of information about habitat quality and conspecific density affects the evolution of dispersal strategies. We found a rather strong influence of variation in information on the overall rate of dispersal in a metapopulation. The highest emigration rate evolved in organisms with no information about either density or habitat quality and the lowest rate was found in organisms with information about both the natal and the neighbouring patches. For organisms that can make use of information about conspecific density, positively density-dependent dispersal evolved in the majority of cases, with the strongest density dependence occurring when an individual only has information about density in the natal patch.

  {"id":"englerMigClimPredictingPlant2009","abstract":"Aim Many studies have forecasted the possible impact of climate change on plant distributions using models based on ecological niche theory, but most of them have ignored dispersal-limitations, assuming dispersal to be either unlimited or null. Depending on the rate of climatic change, the landscape fragmentation and the dispersal capabilities of individual species, these assumptions are likely to prove inaccurate, leading to under- or overestimation of future species distributions and yielding large uncertainty between these two extremes. As a result, the concepts of ‘potentially suitable’ and ‘potentially colonizable’ habitat are expected to differ significantly. To quantify to what extent these two concepts can differ, we developed MigClim, a model simulating plant dispersal under climate change and landscape fragmentation scenarios. MigClim implements various parameters, such as dispersal distance, increase in reproductive potential over time, landscape fragmentation or long-distance dispersal. Location Western Swiss Alps. Methods Using our MigClim model, several simulations were run for two virtual species by varying dispersal distance and other parameters. Each simulation covered the 100-year period 2001–2100 and three different IPCC-based temperature warming scenarios were considered. Results of dispersal-limited projections were compared with unlimited and no-dispersal projections. Results Our simulations indicate that: (1) using realistic parameter values, the future potential distributions generated using MigClim can differ significantly (up to more than 95% difference in colonized surface) from those that ignore dispersal; (2) this divergence increases under more extreme climate warming scenarios and over longer time periods; and (3) the uncertainty associated with the warming scenario can be as large as the one related to dispersal parameters.

  {"id":"eppersonUtilityComputerSimulations2010","abstract":"Population genetics theory is primarily based on mathematical models in which spatial complexity and temporal variability are largely ignored. In contrast, the field of landscape genetics expressly focuses on how population genetic processes are affected by complex spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity. It is spatially explicit and relates patterns to processes by combining complex and realistic life histories, behaviours, landscape features and genetic data. Central to landscape genetics is the connection of spatial patterns of genetic variation to the usually highly stochastic space–time processes that create them over both historical and contemporary time periods. The field should benefit from a shift to computer simulation approaches, which enable incorporation of demographic and environmental stochasticity. A key role of simulations is to show how demographic processes such as dispersal or reproduction interact with landscape features to affect probability of site occupancy, population size, and gene flow, which in turn determine spatial genetic structure. Simulations could also be used to compare various statistical methods and determine which have correct type I error or the highest statistical power to correctly identify spatio-temporal and environmental effects. Simulations may also help in evaluating how specific spatial metrics may be used to project future genetic trends. This article summarizes some of the fundamental aspects of spatial–temporal population genetic processes. It discusses the potential use of simulations to determine how various spatial metrics can be rigorously employed to identify features of interest, including contrasting locus-specific spatial patterns due to micro-scale environmental selection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Epperson","given":"Bryan K."},{"family":"Mcrae","given":"Brad H."},{"family":"Scribner","given":"Kim"},{"family":"Cushman","given":"Samuel A."},{"family":"Rosenberg","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Fortin","given":"Marie-Josée"},{"family":"James","given":"Patrick M.

For instance, spatial expansions can generate allele frequency gradients, promote the surfing of rare variants into newly occupied territories, induce the structuring of newly colonized areas into distinct sectors of low genetic diversity, or lead to massive introgression of local genes into the genome of an invading species.

It is also very diverse, with different authors measuring fragmentation in different ways and, as a consequence, drawing different conclusions regarding both the magnitude and direction of its effects. Habitat fragmentation is usually defined as a landscape-scale process involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habitat. Results of empirical studies of habitat fragmentation are often difficult to interpret because (a) many researchers measure fragmentation at the patch scale, not the landscape scale and (b) most researchers measure fragmentation in ways that do not distinguish between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat after controlling for habitat loss. Empirical studies to date suggest that habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity. Habitat fragmentation per se has much weaker effects on biodiversity that are at least as likely to be positive as negative. Therefore, to correctly interpret the influence of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, the effects of these two components of fragmentation must be measured independently. More studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation per se are needed to determine the factors that lead to positive versus negative effects of fragmentation per se.

Using this simplification I group the range of evolved movement parameters into four categories or movement types. I then discuss how these movement types interact with current human-caused landscape changes, and how this often results in non-optimal movement. 3 From this synthesis I develop a hypothesis that predicts the relative importance of the different population-level consequences of these non-optimal movements, for the four movement types. 4 Populations of species that have inhabited landscapes with high habitat cover or patchy landscapes with low-risk matrix should have evolved low boundary responses and moderate to high movement probabilities. These species are predicted to be highly susceptible to increased movement mortality resulting from habitat loss and reduced matrix quality. 5 In contrast, populations of species that evolved in patchy landscapes with high-risk matrix or dynamic patchy landscapes are predicted to be highly susceptible to decreased immigration and colonization success, due to the increasing patch isolation that results from habitat loss. 6 Finally, I discuss three implications of this synthesis: (i) ‘least cost path’ analysis should not be used for land management decisions without data on actual movement paths and movement risks in the landscape; (ii) ‘dispersal ability’ is not simply an attribute of a species, but varies strongly with landscape structure such that the relative rankings of species’ dispersal abilities can change following landscape alteration; and (iii) the assumption that more mobile species are more resilient to human-caused landscape change is not generally true, but depends on the structure of the landscape where the species evolved.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Fahrig","given":"Lenore"}],"container-title":"Functional Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01326.x","ISSN":"1365-2435","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01326.x","page":"1003-1015","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Non-optimal animal movement in human-altered landscapes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01326.x","volume":"21"},

We investigated the cues underlying density-dependent dispersal in inter-connected microcosms of the freshwater protozoan Paramecium caudatum. In two experiments, we manipulated (i) the number of cells per microcosm and (ii) the origin of their culture medium (supernatant from high- or low-density populations). We found a negative relationship between population density and rates of dispersal, suggesting the use of physical cues. There was no significant effect of culture medium origin on dispersal and thus no support for chemical cues usage. These results suggest that the perception of density – and as a result, the decision to disperse – in this organism can be based on physical factors.

Human-perceived landscape patterns that are frequently correlated with species assemblages include the amount and structure of native vegetation, the prevalence of anthropogenic edges, the degree of landscape connectivity, and the structure and heterogeneity of modified areas.

Conspecific attraction during searching or settlement decisions had different consequences for animals: attraction while searching increased survival by decreasing time spent in nonsuitable habitat, whereas attraction during settlement increased fecundity by aggregating animals in high‐quality habitats. Habitat‐based sampling did not improve fitness over attraction, but directly sampling habitat quality resulted in the highest short‐term fitness among strategies. These results suggest that attraction can improve fitness when animals cannot directly assess habitat quality.

  {"id":"fletcherSpeciesInteractionsPopulation2007","abstract":"1. The perspective that populations and communities are structured by antagonistic interactions among individuals has dominated much of ecology. Yet how animals use social information to guide decisions, such as habitat selection, may be influenced by both positive and negative interactions among individuals. Recent theory also suggests that the way animals use social information may be substantially influenced by population density, which alters the potential costs and benefits of such behaviours. 2. I manipulated cues of two competitors, the dominant least flycatcher Empidonax minimus (Baird & Baird) and the subordinate American redstart Setophaga ruticilla (Linnaeus), to assess the use of conspecific and heterospecific cues during habitat selection, and if population density influences these strategies. The experiment consisted of surveying birds during a pre-treatment year, which allows for the control and testing the effect of baseline densities, and a treatment year, in which treatments were applied just prior to settlement. Treatments included broadcasting songs of flycatchers and redstarts, and were compared with controls. 3. When controlling for pre-treatment densities, bird densities, and to a lesser extent arrival dates, during the treatment year suggested that flycatchers were attracted to both conspecific and heterospecific cues during settlement. Furthermore, attraction was strongest for flycatchers in plots with moderate pre-treatment densities. American redstarts were rare in the study area but showed apparent attraction to conspecifics and avoidance of heterospecifics. 4. These results provide experimental evidence for the use of multiple social cues in habitat selection and suggest that heterospecific attraction may operate under broader contexts than originally envisioned. In such instances, nontarget effects can potentially occur when manipulating social cues to elicit settlement in conservation strategies. The impact of population density on the use of social cues shown here can also influence our understanding of metapopulation dynamics by causing complex threshold effects on the likelihood of rescue, which may influence metapopulation stability and the likelihood of local extinction.","author":[{"family":"Fletcher","given":"Robert J."}],"container-title":"The Journal of Animal Ecology","container-title-short":"J Anim Ecol","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2656.2007.01230.x","ISSN":"0021-8790","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,5]]},"language":"eng","page":"598-606","PMID":"17439476","source":"PubMed","title":"Species interactions and population density mediate the use of social cues for habitat selection","type":"article-journal","volume":"76"},
  {"id":"fowlerConfoundingEnvironmentalColour2013","abstract":"The colour of environmental variability influences the size of population fluctuations when filtered through density dependent dynamics, driving extinction risk through dynamical resonance. Slow fluctuations (low frequencies) dominate in red environments, rapid fluctuations (high frequencies) in blue environments and white environments are purely random (no frequencies dominate). Two methods are commonly employed to generate the coloured spatial and/or temporal stochastic (environmental) series used in combination with population (dynamical feedback) models: autoregressive [AR(1)] and sinusoidal (1/f) models. We show that changing environmental colour from white to red with 1/f models, and from white to red or blue with AR(1) models, generates coloured environmental series that are not normally distributed at finite time-scales, potentially confounding comparison with normally distributed white noise models. Increasing variability of sample Skewness and Kurtosis and decreasing mean Kurtosis of these series alter the frequency distribution shape of the realised values of the coloured stochastic processes. These changes in distribution shape alter patterns in the probability of single and series of extreme conditions. We show that the reduced extinction risk for undercompensating (slow growing) populations in red environments previously predicted with traditional 1/f methods is an artefact of changes in the distribution shapes of the environmental series. This is demonstrated by comparison with coloured series controlled to be normally distributed using spectral mimicry. Changes in the distribution shape that arise using traditional methods lead to underestimation of extinction risk in normally distributed, red 1/f environments. AR(1) methods also underestimate extinction risks in traditionally generated red environments. This work synthesises previous results and provides further insight into the processes driving extinction risk in model populations. We must let the characteristics of known natural environmental covariates (e.g., colour and distribution shape) guide us in our choice of how to best model the impact of coloured environmental variation on population dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Fowler","given":"Mike S."},{"family":"Ruokolainen","given":"Lasse"}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0055855","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,2,11]]},"language":"en","page":"e55855","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Confounding Environmental Colour and Distribution Shape Leads to Underestimation of Population Extinction Risk","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055855","volume":"8"},

Climate change thus provides an opportunity for the study of the genetic basis of adaptation.

These approaches can be combined with a number of techniques in genetics and genomics, including association and mapping analyses, genome scans, and transcription profiling. Recent research has revealed a number of candidate genes potentially involved in climate change adaptation and has also illustrated that genetic regulatory networks and epigenetic effects may be particularly relevant for evolution driven by climate change.

We aimed to characterize the range expansion of the American mink (Neovison vison) invading from multiple introduction points through a varied landscape bounded by coastline to better understand and manage its spread. Location Scotland, UK. Method We collated and used records of mink presence to calculate the historical range and rate of range expansion at successive time intervals. We used a presence-only model to predict habitat suitability and a newly developed individual-based modelling platform, RangeShifter, to simulate range expansion. Results Records showed that mink were distributed throughout Scotland, except in the far north. We found that the rate of spread varied both spatially and temporally and was related to landscape heterogeneity. Habitat suitable for mink in west Scotland is restricted to the coast. Main conclusions We concluded that temporal and spatial variation in range expansion is attributable to heterogeneity within the landscape and also demonstrated that the potential for long-distance dispersal does not necessarily facilitate range expansion when availability of suitable habitat occurs in narrow strips and/or is fragmented. We have highlighted methodological gaps in calculating rates of expansion in invasive species but have demonstrated alternative methods that successfully utilize presence-only data. Our study reaffirms that invasive species will colonize less favourable habitats and highlights the need to remain vigilant of their potential for expansion even when distribution appears to be static for a time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Fraser","given":"Elaine J."},{"family":"Lambin","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Travis","given":"Justin M.

  {"id":"fronhoferPickyHitchhikersVector2013a","abstract":"Dispersal is a central life-history trait for most animals and plants: it allows to colonize new habitats, escape from competition or avoid inbreeding. Yet, not all species are mobile enough to perform sufficient dispersal. Such passive dispersers may use more mobile animals as dispersal vectors. If multiple potential vectors are available, an active choice can allow to optimize the dispersal process and to determine the distribution of dispersal distances, i.e. an optimal dispersal kernel. We explore dispersal and vector choice in the neotropical flower mite Spadiseius calyptrogynae using a dual approach which combines experiments with an individual-based simulation model. Spadiseius calyptrogynae is found in lowland rainforests in Costa Rica. It inhabits inflorescences of the understorey palm Calyptrogyne ghiesbreghtiana and is phoretic on a number of flower visitors including bats, beetles and stingless bees. We hypothesised that the mites should optimise their dispersal kernel by actively choosing a specific mix of potential phoretic vectors. In a simple olfactometer setup we showed that the flower mites do indeed discriminate between potential vectors. Subsequently we used an individual-based model to analyse the evolutionary forces responsible for the observed patterns of vector choice. The mites combine vectors exhibiting long-distance dispersal with those allowing for more localized dispersal. This results in a fat-tailed dispersal kernel that guarantees the occasional colonization of new host plant patches (long distance) while optimizing the exploitation of clumped resources (local dispersal). Additionally, kin competition results in a preference for small vectors that transport only few individuals at a time. At the same time, these vectors lead to directed dispersal towards suitable habitat, which increases the stability of this very specialized interaction. Our findings can be applied to other phoretic systems but also to vector-based seed dispersal, for example.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Fronhofer","given":"Emanuel A."},{"family":"Sperr","given":"Ellen B."},{"family":"Kreis","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Ayasse","given":"Manfred"},{"family":"Poethke","given":"Hans Joachim"},{"family":"Tschapka","given":"Marco"}],"container-title":"Oikos","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00503.x","ISSN":"1600-0706","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00503.x","page":"1254-1264","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Picky hitch-hikers: vector choice leads to directed dispersal and fat-tailed kernels in a passively dispersing mite","title-short":"Picky hitch-hikers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00503.x","volume":"122"},

We tested the generality of this paradigm for free-ranging elk (Cervus elaphus) over 5 orders of magnitude in time (minutes to years) and space (meters to 100 km). At the coarsest spatiotemporal scale, elk shifted from a dispersive to a home-ranging phase over the course of 1–3 years after introduction into a novel environment. At intermediate spatiotemporal scales, elk continued to alternate between movement modes. During the dispersive phase, elk alternated between encamped and exploratory modes, possibly linked to changes in motivational goals from foraging to social bonding. During the home-ranging phase, elk movements were characterized by a complex interplay between attraction to preferred habitat types and memory of previous movements across the home-range. At the finest temporal and spatial scale, elk used area-restricted search while browsing, interspersed with less sinuous paths when not browsing. Encountering a patch of high-quality food plants triggered the switch from one mode to the next, creating biphasic movement dynamics that were reinforced by local resource heterogeneity. These patterns suggest that multiphasic structure is fundamental to the movement patterns of elk at all temporal and spatial scales tested.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Fryxell","given":"John M."},{"family":"Hazell","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Börger","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Dalziel","given":"Ben D."},{"family":"Haydon","given":"Daniel T."},{"family":"Morales","given":"Juan M."},{"family":"McIntosh","given":"Therese"},{"family":"Rosatte","given":"Rick C."}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0801737105","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"49","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,12,9]]},"language":"en","page":"19114-19119","PMID":"19060190","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Research Article","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Multiple movement modes by large herbivores at multiple spatiotemporal scales","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/105/49/19114","volume":"105"},

Differences in landscape pattern were simulated by random generation of fractal maps with average available energy (i.e. prey) and predation risk expressed as a function of habitat type. Variation in species-specific patterns were then simulated by a series of scenarios that varied the response of dispersing individuals to habitat heterogeneity, including: habitat selection to maximize energy intake, habitat selection to minimize predation risk, or habitat selection contingent on energy reserves. Results showed that significant shifts in dispersal could be related to (1) the unique spatial arrangement of habitat within each map, (2) changes in relative prey abundance, and (3) variation in the relationship between energy availability and predation risk.

There is theoretical and empirical evidence for systematic changes towards range limits under some circumstances in each of the demographic parameters.

  {"id":"gilroyMateFindingOverlookedCritical2012","abstract":"Dispersal is a critically important process in ecology, but robust predictive models of animal dispersal remain elusive. We identify a potentially ubiquitous component of variation in animal dispersal that has been largely overlooked until now: the influence of mate encounters on settlement probability. We use an individual-based model to simulate dispersal in sexually-reproducing organisms that follow a simple set of movement rules based on conspecific encounters, within an environment lacking spatial habitat heterogeneity. We show that dispersal distances vary dramatically with fluctuations in population density in such a model, even in the absence of variation in dispersive traits between individuals. In a simple random-walk model with promiscuous mating, dispersal distributions become increasingly ‘fat-tailed’ at low population densities due to the increasing scarcity of mates. Similar variation arises in models incorporating territoriality. In a model with polygynous mating, we show that patterns of sex-biased dispersal can even be reversed across a gradient of population density, despite underlying dispersal mechanisms remaining unchanged. We show that some widespread dispersal patterns found in nature (e.g. fat tailed distributions) can arise as a result of demographic variability in the absence of heterogeneity in dispersive traits across the population. This implies that models in which individual dispersal distances are considered to be fixed traits might be unrealistic, as dispersal distances vary widely under a single dispersal mechanism when settlement is influenced by mate encounters. Mechanistic models offer a promising means of advancing our understanding of dispersal in sexually-reproducing organisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Gilroy","given":"James J."},{"family":"Lockwood","given":"Julie L."}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0038091","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,5,25]]},"language":"en","page":"e38091","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Mate-Finding as an Overlooked Critical Determinant of Dispersal Variation in Sexually-Reproducing Animals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0038091","volume":"7"},

We study the mechanisms that can bring this about, focusing on the key concepts of excitation and suppression which emerge when analysing the power spectra of the system in linear approximation. Excitation, through resonance between the system dynamics and the external forcing, is the greater the closer the system is to the boundary of the stability region. This amplification means that the extinction of populations becomes possible sooner than expected and, conversely, invasion can be significantly delayed. Suppression and the consequent redistribution of power within the spectrum proves to be a function both of the connectivity of the network graph of the system and the way that external forcing is applied to the system. It is also established that colour in stochastic forcing can have a major impact, by enhancing resonance and by greater redistribution of power. This can mean a higher risk of extinction through larger fluctuations in population numbers and a higher degree of synchrony between populations.

Recent advances in SDMs allow us to potentially forecast anthropogenic effects on patterns of biodiversity at different spatial scales. However, some limitations still preclude the use of SDMs in many theoretical and practical applications. Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in this field, discuss the ecological principles and assumptions underpinning SDMs, and highlight critical limitations and decisions inherent in the construction and evaluation of SDMs. Particular emphasis is given to the use of SDMs for the assessment of climate change impacts and conservation management issues. We suggest new avenues for incorporating species migration, population dynamics, biotic interactions and community ecology into SDMs at multiple spatial scales. Addressing all these issues requires a better integration of SDMs with ecological theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Guisan","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Thuiller","given":"Wilfried"}],"container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00792.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00792.x","page":"993-1009","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Predicting species distribution: offering more than simple habitat models","title-short":"Predicting species distribution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00792.x","volume":"8"},

The distribution of seasonal mean temperature anomalies has shifted toward higher temperatures and the range of anomalies has increased. An important change is the emergence of a category of summertime extremely hot outliers, more than three standard deviations (3σ) warmer than the climatology of the 1951–1980 base period. This hot extreme, which covered much less than 1% of Earth’s surface during the base period, now typically covers about 10% of the land area. It follows that we can state, with a high degree of confidence, that extreme anomalies such as those in Texas and Oklahoma in 2011 and Moscow in 2010 were a consequence of global warming because their likelihood in the absence of global warming was exceedingly small.

Among females from new populations, mobility decreased with increasing connectivity (decreasing isolation), but in females from old populations mobility increased with connectivity. The [ATP]/[ADP] ratio of flight muscles following controlled activity showed the same pattern as mobility in relation to population age and connectivity, suggesting that physiological differences in flight metabolic performance contribute to the observed variation in mobility.

  {"id":"hartigConnectingDynamicVegetation2012","abstract":"Dynamic vegetation models provide process-based explanations of the dynamics and the distribution of plant ecosystems. They offer significant advantages over static, correlative modelling approaches, particularly for ecosystems that are outside their equilibrium due to global change or climate change. A persistent problem, however, is their parameterization. Parameters and processes of dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) are traditionally determined independently of the model, while model outputs are compared to empirical data for validation and informal model comparison only. But field data for such independent estimates of parameters and processes are often difficult to obtain, and the desire to include better descriptions of processes such as biotic interactions, dispersal, phenotypic plasticity and evolution in future vegetation models aggravates limitations related to the current parameterization paradigm. In this paper, we discuss the use of Bayesian methods to bridge this gap. We explain how Bayesian methods allow direct estimates of parameters and processes, encoded in prior distributions, to be combined with inverse estimates, encoded in likelihood functions. The combination of direct and inverse estimation of parameters and processes allows a much wider range of vegetation data to be used simultaneously, including vegetation inventories, species traits, species distributions, remote sensing, eddy flux measurements and palaeorecords. The possible reduction of uncertainty regarding structure, parameters and predictions of DVMs may not only foster scientific progress, but will also increase the relevance of these models for policy advice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Hartig","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Dyke","given":"James"},{"family":"Hickler","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Higgins","given":"Steven I."},{"family":"O’Hara","given":"Robert B."},{"family":"Scheiter","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Huth","given":"Andreas"}],"container-title":"Journal of Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2699.2012.02745.x","ISSN":"1365-2699","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2012.02745.x","page":"2240-2252","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Connecting dynamic vegetation models to data – an inverse perspective","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2012.02745.x","volume":"39"},

Many important systems in ecology and biology, however, are difficult to capture with statistical models. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they were hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and thus it is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics, and efficient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for integrating stochastic simulation models into a unified framework for statistical modelling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Hartig","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Calabrese","given":"Justin M."},{"family":"Reineking","given":"Björn"},{"family":"Wiegand","given":"Thorsten"},{"family":"Huth","given":"Andreas"}],"container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01640.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01640.x","page":"816-827","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Statistical inference for stochastic simulation models – theory and application","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01640.x","volume":"14"},

However, the cues that dispersing animals respond to are not well understood: differences in habitat quality ultimately may be important, but whether animals respond to these differences may be influenced by their own familiarity with different habitats. 2 To determine if dispersers reacted to differences in habitat, we documented the exploratory movements, dispersal, and settlement patterns of juvenile North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) originating in adjacent patches of different habitats. 3 Dispersers originating in mature, closed-canopy forest (linked to higher female reproductive success and smaller territories) did not explore contrasting open forest with lower tree densities, and the magnitude of the dispersers’ explorations was relatively similar. In contrast, dispersers from the open forest habitat made explorations that carried them into contrasting, mature forest habitat, and their explorations were more variable across individuals. 4 When settlement occurred, it was strongly philopatric in all groups of dispersers, although the distances and directions favoured during the exploratory phase of dispersal remained strong predictors of where settlement occurred. Overall, processes favouring philopatry (i.e. maternal influences, competitive advantages, etc.) appeared to dominate the dispersal of our study animals, even those that were exposed to higher quality habitat during their explorations. 5 Secondarily, annual stochasticity (or some correlate) affected the scale of exploration and timing of settlement more than the relative quality of habitat in which dispersers were born. 6 Studies such as this that seek to understand the relative importance of individual experience, habitat familiarity, and habitat quality are important to ultimately understanding how individual animals and populations react to habitat heterogeneity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Haughland","given":"Diane L."},{"family":"Larsen","given":"Karl W."}],"container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00884.x","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00884.x","page":"1024-1034","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Exploration correlates with settlement: red squirrel dispersal in contrasting habitats","title-short":"Exploration correlates with settlement","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00884.x","volume":"73"},

The ways in which the elements have been brought together are reviewed with particular emphasis on dispersal distance distributions and the value of mechanistic models. 2 There is a continuous range of movement behaviours and in some species, dispersal is a clearly delineated event but not in others. The biological complexities restrict conclusions to high-level generalizations but there may be principles that are common to dispersal and other movements. 3 Random walk and diffusion models when appropriately elaborated can provide an understanding of dispersal distance relationships on spatial and temporal scales relevant to dispersal. Leptokurtosis in the relationships may be the result of a combination of factors including population heterogeneity, correlation, landscape features, time integration and density dependence. The inclusion in diffusion models of individual variation appears to be a useful elaboration. The limitations of the negative exponential and other phenomenological models are discussed. 4 The dynamics of metapopulation models are sensitive to what appears to be small differences in the assumptions about dispersal. In order to represent dispersal realistically in population models, it is suggested that phenomenological models should be replaced by those based on movement behaviour incorporating individual variation. 5 The conclusions are presented as a set of candidate principles for evaluation. The main features of the principles are that uncorrelated or correlated random walk, not linear movement, is expected where the directions of habitat patches are unpredictable and more complex behaviour when organisms have the ability to orientate or navigate. Individuals within populations vary in their movement behaviour and dispersal; part of this variation is a product of random elements in movement behaviour and some of it is heritable. Local and metapopulation dynamics are influenced by population heterogeneity in dispersal characteristics and heritable changes in dispersal propensity occur on time-scales short enough to impact population dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Hawkes","given":"Colin"}],"container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01534.x","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01534.x","page":"894-906","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Linking movement behaviour, dispersal and population processes: is individual variation a key?","title-short":"Linking movement behaviour, dispersal and population processes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01534.x","volume":"78"},

Particular attention is paid to recent developments of bioclimatic modelling that address some of these issues as well as to the topics where more progress needs to be made. Developing and applying bioclimatic models in a informative way requires good understanding of a wide range of methodologies, including the choice of modelling technique, model validation, collinearity, autocorrelation, biased sampling of explanatory variables, scaling and impacts of non-climatic factors. A key challenge for future research is integrating factors such as land cover, direct CO2 effects, biotic interactions and dispersal mechanisms into species-climate models.

  {"id":"heinoEvolutionMigrationRate2001","abstract":"We use an individual-based, spatially realistic metapopulation model to study the evolution of migration rate. We first explore the consequences of habitat change in hypothetical patch networks on a regular lattice. If the primary consequence of habitat change is an increase in local extinction risk as a result of decreased local population sizes, migration rate increases. A nonmonotonic response, with migration rate decreasing at high extinction rate, was obtained only by assuming very frequent catastrophes. If the quality of the matrix habitat deteriorates, leading to increased mortality during migration, the evolutionary response is more complex. As long as habitat patch occupancy does not decrease markedly with increased migration mortality, reduced migration rate evolves. However, once mortality becomes so high that empty patches remain uncolonized for a long time, evolution tends to increase migration rate, which may lead to an \"evolutionary rescue\" in a fragmented landscape. Kin competition has a quantitative effect on the evolution of migration rate in our model, but these patterns in the evolution of migration rate appear to be primarily caused by spatiotemporal variation in fitness and mortality during migration. We apply the model to real habitat patch networks occupied by two checkerspot butterfly (Melitaea) species, for which sufficient data are available to estimate rigorously most of the model parameters. The model-predicted migration rate is not significantly different from the empirically observed one. Regional variation in patch areas and connectivities leads to regional variation in the optimal migration rate, predictions that can be tested empirically.","author":[{"family":"Heino","given":"M."},{"family":"Hanski","given":"I."}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"Am Nat","DOI":"10.1086/319927","ISSN":"1537-5323","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,5]]},"language":"eng","page":"495-511","PMID":"18707258","source":"PubMed","title":"Evolution of migration rate in a spatially realistic metapopulation model","type":"article-journal","volume":"157"},

Yet many studies have not demonstrated local adaptation, suggesting that sometimes native populations are no better adapted than are genotypes from foreign environments. Local adaptation may also lead to trade-offs, in which adaptation to one environment comes at a cost of adaptation to another environment. I conducted a survey of published studies of local adaptation to quantify its frequency and magnitude and the costs associated with local adaptation. I also quantified the relationship between local adaptation and environmental differences and the relationship between local adaptation and phenotypic divergence. The overall frequency of local adaptation was 0.71, and the magnitude of the native population advantage in relative fitness was 45%. Divergence between home site environments was positively associated with the magnitude of local adaptation, but phenotypic divergence was not. I found a small negative correlation between a population's relative fitness in its native environment and its fitness in a foreign environment, indicating weak trade-offs associated with local adaptation. These results suggest that populations are often locally adapted but stochastic processes such as genetic drift may limit the efficacy of divergent selection.","author":[{"family":"Hereford","given":"Joe"}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"Am Nat","DOI":"10.1086/597611","ISSN":"1537-5323","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,5]]},"language":"eng","page":"579-588","PMID":"19272016","source":"PubMed","title":"A quantitative survey of local adaptation and fitness trade-offs","type":"article-journal","volume":"173"},

This enormous amount of information is difficult to review and highlights the need to assess the collective completeness of movement studies and identify gaps. We surveyed 1,000 randomly selected papers from 496 journals and compared the facets of movement studied with a suggested framework for movement ecology, consisting of internal state (motivation, physiology), motion and navigation capacities, and external factors (both the physical environment and living organisms), and links among these components. Most studies simply measured and described the movement of organisms without reference to ecological or internal factors, and the most frequently studied part of the framework was the link between external factors and motion capacity. Few studies looked at the effects on movement of navigation capacity, or internal state, and those were mainly from vertebrates. For invertebrates and plants most studies were at the population level, whereas more vertebrate studies were conducted at the individual level. Consideration of only population-level averages promulgates neglect of between-individual variation in movement, potentially hindering the study of factors controlling movement.

  {"id":"hovestadtAllInterpatchMovements2011","abstract":"1. In times of ongoing habitat fragmentation, the persistence of many species is determined by their dispersal abilities. Consequently, understanding the rules underlying movement between habitat patches is a key issue in conservation ecology. 2. We have analysed mark-release-recapture (MRR) data on inter-patches movements of the Dusky Large Blue butterfly Maculinea nausithous in a fragmented landscape in northern Bavaria, Germany. The aim of the analysis was to quantify distance dependence of dispersal as well as to evaluate the effect of target patch area on immigration probability. For statistical evaluation, we apply a 'reduced version' of the virtual migration model (VM), only fitting parameters for dispersal distance and immigration. In contrast to other analyses, we fit a mixed dispersal kernel to the MRR data. 3. A large fraction of recaptures happened in other habitat patches than those where individuals were initially caught. Further, we found significant evidence for the presence of a mixed dispersal kernel. The results indicate that individuals follow different strategies in their movements. Most movements are performed over small distances, nonetheless involving travelling between nearby habitat patches (median distance c. 480 m). A small fraction (c. 0·025) of the population has a tendency to move over larger distances (median distance c. 3800 m). Further, immigration was positively affected by patch area (I∼A(ζ) ), with the scaling parameter ζ = 0·5. 4. Our findings should help to resolve the long-lasting dispute over the suitability of the negative exponential function vs. inverse-power one for modelling dispersal. Previous studies on various organisms found that the former typically gives better overall fit to empirical distance distributions, but that the latter better represents long-distance movement probabilities. As long-distance movements are more important for landscape-level effects and thus, e.g. for conservation-oriented analyses like PVAs, fitting inverse-power kernels has often been preferred. 5. We conclude that the above discrepancy may simply stem from the fact that recorded inter-patch movements are an outcome of two different processes: daily routine movements and genuine dispersal. Consequently, applying mixed dispersal kernels to disentangle the two processes is recommended.","author":[{"family":"Hovestadt","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Binzenhöfer","given":"Birgit"},{"family":"Nowicki","given":"Piotr"},{"family":"Settele","given":"Josef"}],"container-title":"The Journal of Animal Ecology","container-title-short":"J Anim Ecol","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01848.x","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,9]]},"language":"eng","page":"1070-1077","PMID":"21585369","source":"PubMed","title":"Do all inter-patch movements represent dispersal?

  {"id":"hovestadtInformationProcessingModels2010","abstract":"Density-dependent emigration has been recognized as a fitness enhancing strategy. Yet, especially in the modelling literature there is no consensus about how density-dependent emigration should quantitatively be incorporated into metapopulation models. In this paper we compare the performance of five different dispersal strategies (defined by the functional link between density and emigration probability). Four of these strategies are based on published functional relationships between local population density and emigration probability, one assumes density-independent dispersal. We use individual-based simulations of time-discrete metapopulation dynamics and conduct evolution experiments for a broad range of values for dispersal mortality and environmental stochasticity. For each set of these conditions we analyze the evolution of emigration rates in ‘monoculture experiments’ (with only one type of dispersal strategy used by all individuals in the metapopulation) as well as in selection experiments that allow a pair-wise comparison of the performance of each functional type. We find that a single-parameter ‘asymptotic threshold’ strategy – derived from the marginal value theorem – with a decelerating increase of emigration rate with increasing population density, out-competes any other strategy, i.e. density-independent emigration, a ‘linear threshold’ strategy and a flexible three-parameter strategy. Only when environmental conditions select for extremely high emigration probabilities (close to one), strategies may perform approximately equally. A simple threshold strategy derived for the case of continuous population growth performs even worse than the density-independent strategy. As the functional type of the dispersal function implemented in metapopulation models may severely affect predictions concerning the survival of populations, range expansion, or community changes we clearly recommend to carefully select adequate functions to model density-dependent dispersal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Hovestadt","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Kubisch","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Poethke","given":"Hans-Joachim"}],"container-title":"Ecological Modelling","container-title-short":"Ecological Modelling","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2009.11.005","ISSN":"0304-3800","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,2,10]]},"language":"en","page":"405-410","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Information processing in models for density-dependent emigration: A comparison","title-short":"Information processing in models for density-dependent emigration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380009007510","volume":"221"},

  {"id":"hughesModellingAnalysingEvolution2007","abstract":"1. Species would be expected to shift northwards in response to current climate warming, but many are failing to do so because of fragmentation of breeding habitats. Dispersal is important for colonisation and an individual-based spatially explicit model was developed to investigate impacts of habitat availability on the evolution of dispersal in expanding populations. Model output was compared with field data from the speckled wood butterfly Pararge aegeria, which currently is expanding its range in Britain. 2. During range expansion, models simulated positive linear relationships between dispersal and distance from the seed location. This pattern was observed regardless of quantity (100% to 10% habitat availability) or distribution (random vs. gradient distribution) of habitat, although higher dispersal evolved at expanding range margins in landscapes with greater quantity of habitat and in gradient landscapes. Increased dispersal was no longer evident in any landscape once populations had reached equilibrium; dispersal values returned to those of seed populations. However, in landscapes with the least quantity of habitat, reduced dispersal (below that of seed populations) was observed at equilibrium. 3. Evolutionary changes in adult flight morphology were examined in six populations of P. aegeria along a transect from the distribution core to an expanding range margin in England (spanning a latitudinal distance of >200 km). Empirical data were in agreement with model output and showed increased dispersal ability (larger and broader thoraxes, smaller abdomens, higher wing aspect ratios) with increasing distance from the distribution core. Increased dispersal ability was evident in populations from areas colonised >30 years previously, although dispersal changes were generally evident only in females. 4. Evolutionary increases in dispersal ability in expanding populations may help species track future climate changes and counteract impacts of habitat fragmentation by promoting colonisation. However, at the highest levels of habitat loss, increased dispersal was less evident during expansion and reduced dispersal was observed at equilibrium indicating that, for many species, continued habitat fragmentation is likely to outweigh any benefits from dispersal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Hughes","given":"Clare L."},{"family":"Dytham","given":"Calvin"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Jane K."}],"container-title":"Ecological Entomology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00890.x","ISSN":"1365-2311","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00890.x","page":"437-445","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Modelling and analysing evolution of dispersal in populations at expanding range boundaries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00890.x","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"jeltschIntegratingMovementEcology2013a","abstract":"Movement of organisms is one of the key mechanisms shaping biodiversity, e.g. the distribution of genes, individuals and species in space and time. Recent technological and conceptual advances have improved our ability to assess the causes and consequences of individual movement, and led to the emergence of the new field of ‘movement ecology’. Here, we outline how movement ecology can contribute to the broad field of biodiversity research, i.e. the study of processes and patterns of life among and across different scales, from genes to ecosystems, and we propose a conceptual framework linking these hitherto largely separated fields of research. Our framework builds on the concept of movement ecology for individuals, and demonstrates its importance for linking individual organismal movement with biodiversity. First, organismal movements can provide ‘mobile links’ between habitats or ecosystems, thereby connecting resources, genes, and processes among otherwise separate locations. Understanding these mobile links and their impact on biodiversity will be facilitated by movement ecology, because mobile links can be created by different modes of movement (i.e., foraging, dispersal, migration) that relate to different spatiotemporal scales and have differential effects on biodiversity. Second, organismal movements can also mediate coexistence in communities, through ‘equalizing’ and ‘stabilizing’ mechanisms. This novel integrated framework provides a conceptual starting point for a better understanding of biodiversity dynamics in light of individual movement and space-use behavior across spatiotemporal scales. By illustrating this framework with examples, we argue that the integration of movement ecology and biodiversity research will also enhance our ability to conserve diversity at the genetic, species, and ecosystem levels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Jeltsch","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Bonte","given":"Dries"},{"family":"Pe'er","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Reineking","given":"Björn"},{"family":"Leimgruber","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Balkenhol","given":"Niko"},{"family":"Schröder","given":"Boris"},{"family":"Buchmann","given":"Carsten M."},{"family":"Mueller","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Blaum","given":"Niels"},{"family":"Zurell","given":"Damaris"},{"family":"Böhning-Gaese","given":"Katrin"},{"family":"Wiegand","given":"Thorsten"},{"family":"Eccard","given":"Jana A."},{"family":"Hofer","given":"Heribert"},{"family":"Reeg","given":"Jette"},{"family":"Eggers","given":"Ute"},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Silke"}],"container-title":"Movement Ecology","container-title-short":"Movement Ecology","DOI":"10.1186/2051-3933-1-6","ISSN":"2051-3933","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,8,5]]},"page":"6","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Integrating movement ecology with biodiversity research - exploring new avenues to address spatiotemporal biodiversity dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/2051-3933-1-6","volume":"1"},

This holds for a sufficiently short correlation time tauc of the fluctuations compared to the internal time scale of population growth r-1 (tauc/r-1<<1). Using a time-discrete simulation model we investigate when the white noise approximation is misleading. Environmental fluctuations are related to fluctuations of the birth and death rates of the species and the temporal correlation of these fluctuations (coloured noise) is described by a first-order autoregressive process. We found that extinction risk increases rapidly with correlation time tauc if the strength of noise is large. In this case the white noise approximation underestimates extinction risk essentially unless temporal correlation is very small (tauc/r-1<<0.1). Extinction risk increases only slowly with correlation time if the strength of noise is small. Then the white noise approximation may be used even for stronger temporal correlations (tauc/r-1>/=0.1). Thus, the estimation of extinction risk on the basis of white or coloured noise must be justified by time scale and strength of the fluctuations.

Using a spatially explicit metapopulation model, we studied the effect of the dispersal range on the persistence of a metapopulation as a function of the local population and landscape dynamics (including habitat patch destruction and subsequent regeneration). Our results show that the impact of the dispersal range depends on both the local population and patch growth. This is due to interactions between dispersal and the dynamics of patches and populations via the number of potential dispersers. In general, long-range dispersal had a positive effect on persistence in a dynamic landscape compared to short-range dispersal. Long-range dispersal increases the number of couplings between the patches and thus the colonisation of regenerated patches. However, long-range dispersal lost its advantage for long-term persistence when the number of potential dispersers was low due to small population growth rates and/or small patch growth rates. Its advantage also disappeared with complex local population dynamics and in a landscape with clumped patch distribution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Johst","given":"Karin"},{"family":"Brandl","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Eber","given":"Sabine"}],"container-title":"Oikos","DOI":"10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.980208.x","ISSN":"1600-0706","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.980208.x","page":"263-270","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Metapopulation persistence in dynamic landscapes: the role of dispersal distance","title-short":"Metapopulation persistence in dynamic landscapes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.980208.x","volume":"98"},

Therefore, spatial population models, that bring together knowledge about a species’ local demography and dispersal behavior, are of growing applied importance. Here, we survey increasingly complex analytical and simulation models that are being developed to describe both demography and dispersal in applied studies. Local population dynamics can be modeled in an unstructured way, by specifying age- or stage-structure or by modeling each individual. Dispersal is often summarized in population-spread models with descriptive and simple statistical models. Mechanistic models that incorporate the physical or behavioral dynamics of dispersal vectors, however, provide more insight and can more readily be applied to novel situations. Importantly, mechanistic models provide a tool for linking variation in species traits and environments to dispersal and population spread. Spatial population models span a wide range: from diffusion models, metapopulation models, integrodifference equation models, and Neubert–Caswell models, to spatially explicit individual-based models. The complexity (and biological realism) of such models often trades off with tractability: for instance, individual-based simulation models allow for unlimited incorporation of biological detail, but rarely for analytical exploration of the model dynamics. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these various spatial population models; the choice of the most appropriate model will depend on the management objective, the biological complexity, available data and the principle of parsimony. We present five case studies of endangered and invasive species for which spatial population models have been developed to inform management, for instance to decrease the spread rate of invasive species or to improve the regional persistence of endangered species. We also anticipate exciting new developments in both spatial analytical and spatial simulation models with increasing demographic, dispersal and spatial sophistication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Jongejans","given":"Eelke"},{"family":"Skarpaas","given":"Olav"},{"family":"Shea","given":"Katriona"}],"collection-title":"Space matters - Novel developments in plant ecology through spatial modelling","container-title":"Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics","container-title-short":"Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics","DOI":"10.1016/j.ppees.2007.09.005","ISSN":"1433-8319","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,3,6]]},"language":"en","page":"153-170","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Dispersal, demography and spatial population models for conservation and control management","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1433831907000467","volume":"9"},

The field of behavioral landscape ecology uses a strong theoretical base to explore, often experimentally, how the behavior of a particular species is affected by heterogeneous and rapidly changing landscapes and can offer valuable insight for managing species in the face of human-induced environmental changes. When interpreted by modelers, results of landscape-level behavioral experiments can be quantified for use in predictive models. To this end, we summarize the methods and results of research using direct experimental manipulation techniques broken into the following categories: translocations, playback experiments, food resource manipulations, manipulations of reproductive success, direct manipulations of the landscape, and manipulations of predation risk. We review and place in a theoretical framework the results from this emerging body of research regarding how organisms move in and respond to different types of landscapes, both natural and human-altered.

The dispersal model was calibrated using telemetric data from the Swiss Jura and based on a map of potential lynx dispersal habitat. 3 Most suitable patches could be interconnected by movements of dispersing lynx within 10 years of reintroduction. However, when realistic levels of mortality risks on roads were applied, most patches become isolated except along the German–Czech border. Consequently, patch connectivity is limited not so much by the distribution of dispersal habitat but by the high mortality of dispersing lynx. Accordingly, rather than solely investing in habitat restoration, management efforts should try to reduce road mortality. 4 Synthesis and applications. Our approach illustrates how spatially explicit dispersal models can guide conservation efforts and reintroduction programmes even where data are scarce. Clear limits imposed by substantial road mortality will affect dispersing lynx as well as other large carnivores, unless offset by careful road-crossing management or by the careful selection of release points in reintroduction programmes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Kramer-Schadt","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Revilla","given":"Eloy"},{"family":"Wiegand","given":"Thorsten"},{"family":"Breitenmoser","given":"Urs"}],"container-title":"Journal of Applied Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00933.x","ISSN":"1365-2664","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00933.x","page":"711-723","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Fragmented landscapes, road mortality and patch connectivity: modelling influences on the dispersal of Eurasian lynx","title-short":"Fragmented landscapes, road mortality and patch connectivity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00933.x","volume":"41"},

In recent years an increasing amount of studies have focused on the influences of density-dependent dispersal on demographic and biogeographical patterns. However, it still remains unclear, to what extent and in what ways this strategy would affect the range formation of species. In order to fill this gap, we present a study using individual-based simulations of a species with discrete generations living along a dispersal mortality gradient. We compare the evolution of range sizes for species following density-dependent and density-independent emigration. Furthermore we assess the influence of environmental stochasticity and Allee effects on range formation, as both processes are known to play an important role for dispersal evolution. We find that density-dependent dispersal always results in much wider ranges than unconditional dispersal. Increasing environmental stochasticity, a predicted consequence of climate change, can remarkably expand the ranges of species living in such connectivity gradients if dispersal decisions are based on local population density. A strong Allee effect causes range contraction for both strategies, but the effect is considerably less dramatic under density-dependent compared to density-independent emigration. We strongly recommend accounting for these findings in future attempts to model species' range shifts due to climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Kubisch","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Poethke","given":"Hans-Joachim"},{"family":"Hovestadt","given":"Thomas"}],"container-title":"Ecography","ISSN":"0906-7590","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"1002-1008","publisher":"Wiley","source":"JSTOR","title":"Density-dependent dispersal and the formation of range borders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/41315778","volume":"34"},

In this study, we evaluate this hypothesis using a spatially explicit individual-based model of populations distributed along environmental gradients. In our experiments we allow the species to spread along a gradient of declining conditions. Results show that range contraction did emerge in a gradient of dispersal mortality, caused by the rapid increase in emigration probability during invasion and selection disfavoring dispersal, once a stable range is formed. However, gradients in growth rate, local extinction rate, and patch capacity did not lead to a noticeable contraction of the range.

However, BEMs are widely applied and have proven to be often useful. Here we investigate, under which conditions evolution of dispersal, local adaptation or interspecific competition may be of minor importance for forecasting future range shifts. Therefore we use individual-based simulations of metapopulations under climate change living in spatial temperature gradients. Scenarios incorporate single-species systems or systems with competing species, respectively. Dispersal rate is evolving and adaptation to local conditions may also evolve in some scenarios. Results show that in single-species scenarios excluding evolutionary adaptation, species either follow optimal habitat conditions or go extinct if habitat connectivity is too low. These simulations are in close accordance to predictions from BEMs. Including evolutionary adaptation qualitatively changes these results. In the absence of competing species the species either completely invades the world or goes extinct. With competitors, results strongly depend on habitat fragmentation. For highly connected habitats the range border may shift as predicted by BEMs, for intermediate connectivity it will lag behind, while species will go extinct if fragmentation is too high. Our results indicate that (simple) BEMs may work well if habitats are well connected and species will not encounter many difficulties in dispersing to new sites. Selection in this case may promote evolution of even higher dispersal activities.

How does the specific type of gradient influence their response? Features of the model: Spatially explicit individual-based simulation of a metapopulation. Logistic population growth and density-dependent emigration. Spatial gradients in habitat isolation, quality, and size. Ranges of the key variables: Environmental stochasticity was modelled as a variation of net reproductive rate (lambda). For a mean reproductive rate of lambda = 2, the standard deviation (sigma) was varied in the range of 0 to 3. Conclusions: When the range margin was predominantly determined by a lack of colonizers, ranges initially expanded with increasing environmental fluctuations, but contracted again when these fluctuations became too strong (sigma textgreater 1). When extinction risk was more important for range formation, the initial expansion was damped or completely absent. When the climate changed too fast to allow for local adaptation of dispersal behaviour, the described patterns were less pronounced.","author":[{"family":"Kubisch","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Poethke","given":"Hans"}],"container-title":"Evolutionary Ecology Research","container-title-short":"Evolutionary Ecology Research","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,2,1]]},"page":"159–169","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Range border formation in a world with increasing climatic variance","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"kunEvolutionDensityDependentDispersal2006","abstract":"It is well-known that dispersal is advantageous in many different ecological situations, e.g. to survive local catastrophes where populations live in spatially and temporally heterogeneous habitats. However, the key question, what kind of dispersal strategy is optimal in a particular situation, has remained unanswered. We studied the evolution of density-dependent dispersal in a coupled map lattice model, where the population dynamics are perturbed by external environmental noise. We used a very flexible dispersal function to enable evolution to select from practically all possible types of monotonous density-dependent dispersal functions. We treated the parameters of the dispersal function as continuously changing phenotypic traits. The evolutionary stable dispersal strategies were investigated by numerical simulations. We pointed out that irrespective of the cost of dispersal and the strength of environmental noise, this strategy leads to a very weak dispersal below a threshold density, and dispersal rate increases in an accelerating manner above this threshold. Decreasing the cost of dispersal increases the skewness of the population density distribution, while increasing the environmental noise causes more pronounced bimodality in this distribution. In case of positive temporal autocorrelation of the environmental noise, there is no dispersal below the threshold, and only low dispersal below it, on the other hand with negative autocorrelation practically all individual disperses above the threshold. We found our results to be in good concordance with empirical observations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Kun","given":"Ádám"},{"family":"Scheuring","given":"István"}],"container-title":"Oikos","ISSN":"0030-1299","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"page":"308-320","publisher":"[Nordic Society Oikos, Wiley]","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Evolution of Density-Dependent Dispersal in a Noisy Spatial Population Model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40235281","volume":"115"},

A quarter of a century since the publication of seminal papers describing general patterns of sex-biased dispersal in both mammals and birds, we review the advances in our theoretical understanding of the evolutionary causes of sex-biased dispersal, and those in statistical genetics that enable us to test hypotheses and measure dispersal in natural populations. We use mammalian examples to illustrate patterns and proximate causes of sex-biased dispersal, because by far the most data are available and because they exhibit an enormous diversity in terms of dispersal strategy, mating and social systems. Recent studies using molecular markers have helped to confirm that sex-biased dispersal is widespread among mammals and varies widely in direction and intensity, but there is a great need to bridge the gap between genetic information, observational data and theory. A review of mammalian data indicates that the relationship between direction of sex-bias and mating system is not a simple one. The role of social systems emerges as a key factor in determining intensity and direction of dispersal bias, but there is still need for a theoretical framework that can account for the complex interactions between inbreeding avoidance, kin competition and cooperation to explain the impressive diversity of patterns.","author":[{"family":"Lawson Handley","given":"L.

  {"id":"legalliardPatternsProcessesDispersal2012","abstract":"A good understanding of mammalian societies requires measuring patterns and comprehending processes of dispersal in each sex. We investigated dispersal behaviour in arvicoline rodents, a subfamily of mammals widespread in northern temperate environments and characterized by a multivoltine life cycle. In arvicoline rodents, variation in life history strategies occurs along a continuum from precocial to delayed maturation that reflects seasonal and ecological fluctuations. We compared dispersal across and within species focusing on the effects of external (condition-dependent) and internal (phenotype-dependent) factors. Our data revealed substantial, unexplained variation between species for dispersal distances and a strong variation within species for both dispersal distance and fraction. Some methodological aspects explained variation across studies, which cautions against comparisons that do not control for them. Overall, the species under consideration display frequent short-distance dispersal events and extremely flexible dispersal strategies, but they also have hitherto unexpected capacity to disperse long distances. Female arvicolines are predominantly philopatric relative to males, but we found no clear association between the mating system and the degree of sex bias in dispersal across species. Dispersal is a response to both various proximate and ultimate factors, including competition, inbreeding avoidance, mate searching and habitat quality. In particular, our review suggests that costs and benefits experienced during transience and settlement are prime determinants of condition dependence. Patterns of phenotype-dependent dispersal are idiosyncratic, except for a widespread association between an exploration/activity syndrome and natal dispersal. Consequences for population dynamics and genetic structures are discussed.","author":[{"family":"Le Galliard","given":"Jean-François"},{"family":"Rémy","given":"Alice"},{"family":"Ims","given":"Rolf A."},{"family":"Lambin","given":"Xavier"}],"container-title":"Molecular Ecology","container-title-short":"Mol Ecol","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05410.x","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,2]]},"language":"eng","page":"505-523","PMID":"22211403","source":"PubMed","title":"Patterns and processes of dispersal behaviour in arvicoline rodents","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"legendreAgeStructureMating2004","abstract":"IntroductionThe fate of populations depends on the life-history traits of the species and possible adaptive changes in these traits in response to selective pressure. In unstructured population models, life-history traits are compounded into few parameters, like the intrinsic growth rate r and the carrying capacity K (see Chapter 2). Structured population models, based on life-cycle graphs, allow the effects of specific life-history traits (survival rates, fecundities, generation time, age at maturity) on population dynamics to be investigated. For example, sensitivities of the growth rate to changes in life-cycle transitions can be computed. Individual life-history traits are important determinants of a population's extinction risk, and are also both factors in and targets of a population's adaptive response to environmental change.When population size is small – always a concern in conservation biology – both individual life-history traits and the structure of interactions between individuals and the genetic system are expected to influence viability. The mating system, for example, may be conducive to an Allee effect (see Chapter 2), and inbreeding depression is a potentially important factor of the extinction process of small populations. In this chapter, we study the interplay between population structure, in terms of age and sex, and population persistence. Two-sex structured models that incorporate specific features of the social mating system and possible differences in male and female life cycles are analyzed.

However, assumptions behind this practice—that no demographic sex differences exist and males are always abundant enough to fertilize all the females—are usually not justified in natural populations. On the contrary, demographic sex differences are common, especially in polygynous species. Previous models that consider sexual reproduction report a stabilizing effect through mixing of different genotypes, thus suggesting a decrease in the propensity for complex dynamics in sexually reproducing populations. Here we show that considering the direct role of males in reproduction and density dependence leads to the conclusion that a two–sex model is not necessarily more stable compared with the corresponding one–sex model. Although solutions exist where sexual reproduction has a stabilizing effect even when no genotypic variability is included (primarily when associated with monogamy), factors like polygyny, sex differences in survival or density dependence, and possible alterations of the primary sex ratio (the Trivers–Willard mechanism), may enlarge the parametric region of complex dynamics. Sexual reproduction therefore does not necessarily increase the stability of population dynamics and can have destabilizing effects, at least in species with complicated mating systems and sexual dimorphism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Lindström","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Kokko","given":"Hanna"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Its value gives the local velocity along the Earth's surface needed to maintain constant temperatures, and is derived from temperature gradients scaled by distance (°C per km) and time (°C per year). The index provides a quantitative view of the role of topography in buffering climate change as it would affect plants and animals: on the IPCC's A1B emission scenario the index has a global mean of 0.42 km per year, compared to extremes of 0.08 and 1.26 km per year for mountains forest biomes and flooded grasslands, respectively.

Species persistence will depend on geographic range shifts or adaptation in response to warming patterns as novel climates and community assemblages arise. Assisted colonization has been proposed as a method for addressing these challenges. This technique, which consists of transporting species to a new range that is predicted to be favorable for persistence under future climate scenarios, has become the subject of controversy and discussion in the conservation community due to its highly manipulative nature, questions about widespread feasibility, and uncertainty associated with the likelihood of translocated species becoming invasive. We reviewed the discussion and criticism associated with assisted colonization and sought to identify other conservation techniques that also display potential to promote the colonization and adaptation of species in response to climate change. We propose an integrated conservation strategy that includes management for habitat connectivity, conservation genetics, and when necessary, assisted colonization of species that are still unable to shift their ranges even given implementation of the above standard conservation approaches. We argue that this integrated approach will facilitate persistence for a larger proportion of species than is possible by solely using assisted colonization.

However, a new approach has emerged for analyzing spatial genetic data without requiring that discrete populations be identified in advance. This approach, landscape genetics, promises to facilitate our understanding of how geographical and environmental features structure genetic variation at both the population and individual levels, and has implications for ecology, evolution and conservation biology.

Various spatial population models have incorporated positively density-dependent dispersal algorithms, and recent theoretical models have explored the conditions for density-dependent dispersal (DD) to evolve. However, while the existence of DD is well documented in some taxa such as insects, there is no clear picture on its generality in vertebrates. Here I review the available empirical data on DD in birds and mammals, focusing mainly on variation in dispersal between years and on experimental density manipulations. Surprisingly few studies have explicitly focused on DD, and interpretation of the available data is often hampered by differences in approach, small sample sizes and/or statistical shortcomings. Positive DD was reported in 50 and 33% of the selected mammal and bird studies, respectively, while two studies on mammals (out of eight) reported negative DD. Among bird studies, DD was more often reported for emigration rates or long-distance recoveries than for average distances within finite study areas. Experimental studies manipulating densities (mainly on mammals) have consistently generated positive DD, typically showing reduced emigration in response to partial population removal. Studies that examined dispersal in relation to seasonal changes in density (small mammals only) have more often reported negative DD. Studies that compared dispersal between sites differing in density, also show a mixture of positive and negative DD. This suggests that dispersal changes in a more complex way with seasonal and spatial density variation than with annual densities, and/or that these results are confounded by other factors differing between seasons and sites, such as habitat quality. I conclude that both correlational and experimental studies support the existence of positive, rather than negative, density-dependent dispersal in birds and mammals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Matthysen","given":"Erik"}],"container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"10.1111/j.0906-7590.2005.04073.x","ISSN":"1600-0587","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.0906-7590.2005.04073.x","page":"403-416","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Density-dependent dispersal in birds and mammals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0906-7590.2005.04073.x","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"mcpeekEvolutionDispersalSpatially1992","abstract":"Using a simple two-patch model, we examine how patterns of spatial and temporal variation in carrying capacities affect natural selection on dispersal. The size of the population in each patch is regulated separately, according to a discrete-generation logistic equation, and individuals disperse from each patch at propensities determined by their genotype. We consider genotypes that express the same dispersal propensities in both patches and genotypes that express patch-specific disperal propensities. Contrary to previous analyses, our results show that some level of dispersal is favored by selection under almost all regimes of habitat variability, including a spatially varying and temporally constant environment. Furthermore, two very different polymorphisms are favored under different conditions. When carrying capacities vary spatially but not temporally, any number of genotypes with patch-specific dispersal propensities in ratios inversely proportional to the ratio of the carrying capacities can coexist. This result extends previous analyses to show that dispersal is favored in such an environment if individuals can alter dispersal propensities in response to environmental cues. In contrast, when carrying capacities vary both spatially and temporally but differ in mean or variance, a polymorphism of only two genotypes (a high-dispersal and a no-dispersal genotype) is favored when the only genotypes possible are ones expressing the same dispersal propensity in both patches. However, this dimorphism can be invaded and replaced by one genotype with a particular combination of patch-specific dispersal propensities in a ratio also inversely proportional to the ratio of the average population sizes. We discuss a number of testable predictions this model suggests about the amounts of phenotypic and genetic variation in dispersal characters that are expected both within and between populations, and the degree to which the expression of phenotypic characters affecting dispersal propensity should be sensitive to environmental conditions. The model also suggests novel mechanisms for coexistence between competing species in varying environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"McPeek","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Holt","given":"Robert D."}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[1992]]},"page":"1010-1027","publisher":"[University of Chicago Press, American Society of Naturalists]","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Evolution of Dispersal in Spatially and Temporally Varying Environments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2462931","volume":"140"},

Here, we tested conflicting predictions from two hypotheses on butterfly movements in relation to habitat fragmentation. According to the resource distribution hypothesis, butterflies in more fragmented landscapes would have higher levels of mobility as resources are more scattered. However, these butterflies could have lower levels of mobility as they experience ‘hard’ habitat boundaries more frequently (i.e. higher crossing costs) compared with butterflies in landscapes with continuous habitat; i.e. the behaviour–at–boundaries hypothesis. We studied movements, habitat boundary crossing and habitat preference of laboratory–reared individuals of Pararge aegeria that originated from woodland and agricultural landscapes, by using an experimental landscape as a common environment (outdoor cages) to test the predictions, taking into account sexual differences and weather. Woodland butterflies covered longer distances, were more prone to cross open–shade boundaries, travelled more frequently between woodland parts of the cages and were more at flight than agricultural butterflies. Our results support the behaviour–at–boundaries hypothesis, with ‘softer’ boundaries for woodland landscapes. Because the butterflies were reared in a common environment, the observed behavioural differences rely on heritable variation between populations from woodland and agricultural landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Merckx","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Dyck","given":"Hans Van"},{"family":"Karlsson","given":"Bengt"},{"family":"Leimar","given":"Olof"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Landscapes that differ in the extent of habitat fragmentation may provide different selection regimes for dispersal, but also for other ecological functions. Several studies on flying insects have shown differences in flight morphology between landscapes, but whether such differences result from plastic responses have rarely been tested. We did a reciprocal transplant experiment with offspring of speckled wood butterfly females (Parargeaegeria) from three types of landscape differing in fragmentation: woodland landscape, landscape with woodland fragments and agricultural landscape with only hedgerows. Young caterpillars were allowed to grow individually on potted host grasses in small enclosures under the three landscape conditions (split-brood design). Mortality in caterpillars was much higher in agricultural landscape compared to the other landscapes. Additive to the effect of landscape of development, landscape of origin also affected mortality rate in a similar way. Flight morphology of the adults resulting from the experiment differed significantly with landscape. Independent of the landscape of origin, males and females that developed in agricultural landscape were the heaviest and had the greatest wing loadings. Females that developed in agricultural landscape had higher relative thorax mass (i.e. greater flight muscle allocation) in line with adaptive predictions on altered dispersal behaviour with type of landscape. In males, relative thorax mass did not respond significantly relative to landscape of development, but males originating from landscape with woodland fragments allocated more into their thorax compared to males from the other types. We found significant G×E interactions for total dry mass and wing loading. Our results suggest the existence of phenotypic plasticity in butterfly flight morphology associated with landscape structure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Merckx","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Dyck","given":"Hans Van"}],"container-title":"Oikos","DOI":"10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14501.x","ISSN":"1600-0706","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14501.x","page":"226-232","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Landscape structure and phenotypic plasticity in flight morphology in the butterfly Pararge aegeria","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14501.x","volume":"113"},

We used insects in laboratory mesocosms to test the effects of sex-biased dispersal on range expansion, and a simulation model to explore interactive effects of sex-biased dispersal and demographic stochasticity. Sex-biased dispersal created spatial clines in the sex ratio, which influenced offspring production at the front and altered invasion velocity.

  {"id":"mitikkaRangeExpansionEuropean2010","abstract":"Climate change will influence the living conditions of all life on Earth. For some species the change in the environmental conditions that has occurred so far has already increased the risk of extinction, and the extinction risk is predicted to increase for large numbers of species in the future. Some species may have time to adapt to the changing environmental conditions, but the rate and magnitude of the change are too great to allow many species to survive via evolutionary changes. \n\nSpecies  responses to climate change have been documented for some decades. Some groups of species, like many insects, respond readily to changes in temperature conditions and have shifted their distributions northwards to new climatically suitable regions. Such range shifts have been well documented especially in temperate zones. In this context, butterflies have been studied more than any other group of species, partly for the reason that their past geographical ranges are well documented, which facilitates species-climate modelling and other analyses. The aim of the modelling studies is to examine to what extent shifts in species distributions can be explained by climatic and other factors. Models can also be used to predict the future distributions of species. \n\nIn this thesis, I have studied the response to climate change of one species of butterfly within one geographically restricted area. The study species, the European map butterfly (Araschnia levana), has expanded rapidly northwards in Finland during the last two decades. I used statistical and dynamic modelling approaches in combination with field studies to analyse the effects of climate warming and landscape structure on the expansion. I studied possible role of molecular variation in phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), a glycolytic enzyme affecting flight metabolism and thereby flight performance, in the observed expansion of the map butterfly at two separate expansion fronts in Finland. \n\nThe expansion rate of the map butterfly was shown to be correlated with the frequency of warmer than average summers during the study period. The result is in line with the greater probability of occurrence of the second generation during warm summers and previous results on this species showing greater mobility of the second than first generation individuals. The results of a field study in this thesis indicated low mobility of the first generation butterflies. Climatic variables alone were not sufficient to explain the observed expansion in Finland. There are also problems in transferring the climate model to new regions from the ones from which data were available to construct the model. The climate model predicted a wider distribution in the south-western part of Finland than what has been observed. Dynamic modelling of the expansion in response to landscape structure suggested that habitat and landscape structure influence the rate of expansion. In southern Finland the landscape structure may have slowed down the expansion rate. The results on PGI suggested that allelic variation in this enzyme may influence flight performance and thereby the rate of expansion. Genetic differences of the populations at the two expansion fronts may explain at least partly the observed differences in the rate of expansion. Individuals with the genotype associated with high flight metabolic rate were most frequent in eastern Finland, where the rate of range expansion has been highest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Mitikka","given":"Varpu"}],"ISBN":"9789521061462","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,3,26]]},"language":"en","note":"Accepted: 2010-11-25T13:18:36Z","publisher":"Helsingin yliopisto","source":"helda.helsinki.fi","title":"The range expansion of the European map butterfly in Finland","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/22114"},

These tools can be used to refine our understanding of the mechanistic links between behaviour and individual condition through ‘spatially informed’ movement models where time allocation to different behaviours affects individual survival and reproduction. For some species, socially informed models that address the movements and average fitness of differently sized groups and how they are affected by fission–fusion processes at relevant temporal scales are required. Furthermore, as most animals revisit some places and avoid others based on their previous experiences, we foresee the incorporation of long-term memory and intention in movement models. The way animals move has important consequences for the degree of mixing that we expect to find both within a population and between individuals of different species.

The dispersal distance that evolves is critically dependent on the ecological dynamics. When the cost of dispersal increases linearly with distance, selection is for short-distance dispersal under stable and damped local dynamics but longer distance dispersal is favoured as local dynamics become more complex. For the cases of stable, damped and periodic patch dynamics global patch synchrony occurs even with very short-distance dispersal. Increasing the scale of dispersal for chaotic local dynamics increases the scale of synchrony but global synchrony does not neccesarily occur.

Models employed to make predictions regarding the impacts of climate change on species' distributions, and ultimately persistence, typically assume that interannual variability in environmental conditions is independent between years. However, the colour of environmental noise has been shown to affect extinction risk in populations occupying spatially static environments, and should therefore affect persistence during climate change. This study aims to investigate the importance of noise colour for extinction risk during climate-induced range shifts. Methods We use a spatially explicit coupled map lattice with a latitudinal gradient in climatic suitability, together with time series of environmental noise, to simulate periods of directional climate change and investigate the effects of noise colour on extinction risk and range size. Results Extinction risk increases with reddening of the environmental noise, and this effect is particularly pronounced over short time frames when climate change is rapid.

  {"id":"nathanMovementEcologyParadigm2008a","abstract":"Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.\n”Now we must consider in general the common reason for moving with any movement whatever.“ (Aristotle, De Motu Animalium, 4th century B.C.)","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Nathan","given":"Ran"},{"family":"Getz","given":"Wayne M."},{"family":"Revilla","given":"Eloy"},{"family":"Holyoak","given":"Marcel"},{"family":"Kadmon","given":"Ronen"},{"family":"Saltz","given":"David"},{"family":"Smouse","given":"Peter E."}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0800375105","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"49","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,12,9]]},"language":"en","page":"19052-19059","PMID":"19060196","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Perspective","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"A movement ecology paradigm for unifying organismal movement research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/105/49/19052","volume":"105"},

  {"id":"northEvolutionaryResponsesDispersal2011","abstract":"It is generally well understood that some ecological factors select for increased and others for decreased dispersal. However, it has remained difficult to assess how the evolutionary dynamics are influenced by the spatio-temporal structure of the environment. We address this question with an individual-based model that enables habitat structure to be controlled through variables such as patch size, patch turnover rate, and patch quality. Increasing patch size at the expense of patch density can select for more or less dispersal, depending on the initial configuration. In landscapes consisting of high-quality and long-lived habitat patches, patch degradation selects for increased dispersal, yet patch loss may select for reduced dispersal. These trends do not depend on the component of life-history that is affected by habitat quality or the component of life-history through which density-dependence operates. Our results are based on a mathematical method that enables derivation of both the evolutionary stable strategy and the stationary genotype distribution that evolves in a polymorphic population. The two approaches generally lead to similar predictions. However, the evolutionary stable strategy assumes that the ecological and evolutionary time scales can be separated, and we find that violation of this assumption can critically alter the evolutionary outcome.","author":[{"family":"North","given":"Ace"},{"family":"Cornell","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Ovaskainen","given":"Otso"}],"container-title":"Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution","container-title-short":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01254.x","ISSN":"1558-5646","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,6]]},"language":"eng","page":"1739-1751","PMID":"21644960","source":"PubMed","title":"Evolutionary responses of dispersal distance to landscape structure and habitat loss","type":"article-journal","volume":"65"},
  {"id":"okamotoFrameworkHighthroughputEcoevolutionary2018","abstract":"The evolutionary dynamics of quantitative traits in a species depends on demographic structure (e.g. age- and size-dependent vital rates, migration across subpopulations, mate preferences, and the presence or absence of overlapping generations), which in turn can depend on interspecific interactions with other evolving species. Furthermore, biologists increasingly appreciate that evolutionary change in a single species can substantively affect broader ecological processes, such as community assembly and ecosystem functioning. Models integrating insights from classical population and quantitative genetics, on the one hand, and community ecology theory, on the other, are therefore critical to elucidating the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes. However, few modelling approaches integrate ecological and genetic details into a comprehensive framework. Such models are needed to account for the reciprocal feedback between evolutionary change and ecological dynamics, and develop effective responses to anthropogenic disturbances on natural communities, improve agricultural practices and manage global health risks such as emerging pathogens. Here we introduce an open-source, multi-species forward-time population genetics simulator and framework for rapidly simulating eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our approach permits building models that can account for alternative genetic architectures, non-standard population dynamics and demographic structures, including those driven by interspecific interactions with other evolving species and the spatial dynamics of metacommunities. By integrating these processes into a common framework, we aim to facilitate the development of models that can further elucidate eco-evolutionary dynamics. While multi-species, forward-time population genetic models can be computationally expensive, we show how our framework leverages relatively economical graphics cards installed in modern desktops. We illustrate the versatility and general applicability of our approach for two very different case studies: antagonistic coevolution in space, and the evolution of life-history traits in response to resource dynamics in physiologically structured populations. We find that our analyses can run up to c. 200 times faster on a single commodity graphics card than on a single CPU core, comparable to the performance gains on small-to-medium sized computer clusters. Our approach therefore substantively reduces implementation difficulties to integrating ecological and evolutionary theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Okamoto","given":"Kenichi W."},{"family":"Amarasekare","given":"Priyanga"}],"container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.12889","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.12889","page":"525-534","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A framework for high-throughput eco-evolutionary simulations integrating multilocus forward-time population genetics and community ecology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12889","volume":"9"},

Current concepts of spatially dynamic metapopulations and species ranges are consistent, and integration improves our understanding of the interaction of landscape level and geographical range level processes. In landscape zones in which the degree of habitat fragmentation allows persistence, the shifting of ranges is inhibited, but not blocked. In areas where the spatial cohesion of the habitat is below the critical level of metapopulation persistence, the expansion of ranges will be blocked. An increased frequency of large-scale disturbances caused by extreme weather events will cause increasing gaps and an overall contraction of the distribution range, particularly in areas with relatively low levels of spatial cohesion.

The model is based on classifying a landscape into a number of habitat types, which are assumed to differ from each other in terms of the movement behavior of the focal species. In addition to habitat-specific diffusion and mortality coefficients, the model accounts for edge-mediated behavior, meaning biased behavior close to boundaries between the habitat types. I illustrate the model with three examples. In the first example, I examine how the strength of edge-mediated behavior and the size of a habitat patch affect the probability that an individual will immigrate to a patch, the probability that an individual will emigrate from a patch, and the time that an individual is expected to spend in a patch. In the second example, I study how a dispersal corridor affects the probability that an individual will move through a landscape. In the third example, I estimate the movement parameters for a species of butterfly from mark–recapture data. In the butterfly example, I classify the landscape into habitat patches, other open areas, and forests. Edge-mediated behavior is found to have a highly significant effect on the general dispersal pattern of the butterfly: the model predicts that the density of butterflies inside habitat patches is >100 times the density of butterflies in adjacent areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Ovaskainen","given":"Otso"}],"container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1890/02-0706","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1890/02-0706","page":"242-257","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Habitat-Specific Movement Parameters Estimated Using Mark–Recapture Data and a Diffusion Model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/02-0706","volume":"85"},

  {"id":"pagelForecastingSpeciesRanges2012a","abstract":"Aim The study and prediction of species–environment relationships is currently mainly based on species distribution models. These purely correlative models neglect spatial population dynamics and assume that species distributions are in equilibrium with their environment. This causes biased estimates of species niches and handicaps forecasts of range dynamics under environmental change. Here we aim to develop an approach that statistically estimates process-based models of range dynamics from data on species distributions and permits a more comprehensive quantification of forecast uncertainties. Innovation We present an approach for the statistical estimation of process-based dynamic range models (DRMs) that integrate Hutchinson's niche concept with spatial population dynamics. In a hierarchical Bayesian framework the environmental response of demographic rates, local population dynamics and dispersal are estimated conditional upon each other while accounting for various sources of uncertainty. The method thus: (1) jointly infers species niches and spatiotemporal population dynamics from occurrence and abundance data, and (2) provides fully probabilistic forecasts of future range dynamics under environmental change. In a simulation study, we investigate the performance of DRMs for a variety of scenarios that differ in both ecological dynamics and the data used for model estimation. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate the importance of considering dynamic aspects in the collection and analysis of biodiversity data. In combination with informative data, the presented framework has the potential to markedly improve the quantification of ecological niches, the process-based understanding of range dynamics and the forecasting of species responses to environmental change.

Here, we incorporate this inter-individual variability into two approaches for estimating connectivity, least cost path analysis and stochastic movement simulation. Illustrative results demonstrate that including dispersal variability can yield substantially different estimates of connectivity.

Our approach integrates features of least cost path analysis with stochastic movement modelling. Importantly, it relaxes assumptions that are implicit in the least cost path algorithm: our method does not assume omniscience nor does it assume that an individual has a planned destination when it leaves a habitat patch. The algorithm incorporates resistance values for matrix elements and parameters that relate to both perceptual range and to the degree of correlation in movement. By simulating sets of movements for individuals emigrating from habitat patches, relative connectivities between habitat patches are estimated. 3. Using an already published stylised landscape, we demonstrate that the connectivities estimated using our new method can differ considerably from those provided by structural methods and by least cost path analysis. Further, our results emphasise the sensitivity of the relative connectivities to an organism’s perceptual range and the degree of correlation between movement steps. 4.

For these species, responses to the warming trend should be slower, reflected in poleward shifts of the range. Such changes in distribution would occur at the level of the population, stemming not from changes in the pattern of individuals' movements, but from changes in the ratios of extinctions to colonizations at the northern and southern boundaries of the range. A northward range shift therefore occurs when there is net extinction at the southern boundary or net colonization at the northern boundary.

  {"id":"pearsonPredictingImpactsClimate2003","abstract":"Modelling strategies for predicting the potential impacts of climate change on the natural distribution of species have often focused on the characterization of a species’ bioclimate envelope. A number of recent critiques have questioned the validity of this approach by pointing to the many factors other than climate that play an important part in determining species distributions and the dynamics of distribution changes. Such factors include biotic interactions, evolutionary change and dispersal ability. This paper reviews and evaluates criticisms of bioclimate envelope models and discusses the implications of these criticisms for the different modelling strategies employed. It is proposed that, although the complexity of the natural system presents fundamental limits to predictive modelling, the bioclimate envelope approach can provide a useful first approximation as to the potentially dramatic impact of climate change on biodiversity. However, it is stressed that the spatial scale at which these models are applied is of fundamental importance, and that model results should not be interpreted without due consideration of the limitations involved. A hierarchical modelling framework is proposed through which some of these limitations can be addressed within a broader, scale-dependent context.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Pearson","given":"Richard G."},{"family":"Dawson","given":"Terence P."}],"container-title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","DOI":"10.1046/j.1466-822X.2003.00042.x","ISSN":"1466-8238","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1466-822X.2003.00042.x","page":"361-371","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Predicting the impacts of climate change on the distribution of species: are bioclimate envelope models useful?","title-short":"Predicting the impacts of climate change on the distribution of species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1466-822X.2003.00042.x","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"peerBreakingFunctionalConnectivity2011","abstract":"Landscape connectivity is a key factor determining the viability of populations in fragmented landscapes. Predicting ‘functional connectivity’, namely whether a patch or a landscape functions as connected from the perspective of a focal species, poses various challenges. First, empirical data on the movement behaviour of species is often scarce. Second, animal-landscape interactions are bound to yield complex patterns. Lastly, functional connectivity involves various components that are rarely assessed separately. We introduce the spatially explicit, individual-based model FunCon as means to distinguish between components of functional connectivity and to assess how each of them affects the sensitivity of species and communities to landscape structures. We then present the results of exploratory simulations over six landscapes of different fragmentation levels and across a range of hypothetical bird species that differ in their response to habitat edges. i) Our results demonstrate that estimations of functional connectivity depend not only on the response of species to edges (avoidance versus penetration into the matrix), the movement mode investigated (home range movements versus dispersal), and the way in which the matrix is being crossed (random walk versus gap crossing), but also on the choice of connectivity measure (in this case, the model output examined). ii) We further show a strong effect of the mortality scenario applied, indicating that movement decisions that do not fully match the mortality risks are likely to reduce connectivity and enhance sensitivity to fragmentation. iii) Despite these complexities, some consistent patterns emerged. For instance, the ranking order of landscapes in terms of functional connectivity was mostly consistent across the entire range of hypothetical species, indicating that simple landscape indices can potentially serve as valuable surrogates for functional connectivity. Yet such simplifications must be carefully evaluated in terms of the components of functional connectivity they actually predict.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Pe'er","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Henle","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Dislich","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Frank","given":"Karin"}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0022355","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e22355","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Breaking Functional Connectivity into Components: A Novel Approach Using an Individual-Based Model, and First Outcomes","title-short":"Breaking Functional Connectivity into Components","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022355","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"peerIncorporatingPerceptualRange2008","abstract":"The perceptual range of an animal towards different landscape elements affects its movements through heterogeneous landscapes. However, empirical knowledge and modeling tools are lacking to assess the consequences of variation in the perceptual range for movement patterns and connectivity. In this study we tested how changes in the assumed perception of different landscape elements affect the outcomes of a connectivity model. We used an existing individual-based, spatially explicit model for the dispersal of Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). We systematically altered the perceptual range in which animals recognize forest fragments, water bodies or cities, as well as the probability that they respond to these landscape elements. Overall, increasing the perceptual range of the animals enhanced connectivity substantially, both qualitatively and quantitatively. An enhanced range of attraction to forests had the strongest impact, doubling immigration success; an enhanced range of attraction to rivers had a slightly lower impact; and an enhanced range of avoidance of cities had the lowest impact. Correcting the enhancement in connectivity by the abundance of each of the landscape elements in question reversed the results, indicating the potential sensitivity of connectivity models to rare landscape elements (in our case barriers such as cities). Qualitatively, the enhanced perception resulted in strong changes in movement patterns and connectivity. Furthermore, model results were highly parameter-specific and patch-specific. These results emphasize the need for further empirical research on the perceptual capabilities of different animals in different landscapes and conditions. They further indicate the usefulness of spatially explicit individual-based simulation models for recognizing consistent patterns that emerge, despite uncertainty regarding animals’ movement behavior. Altogether, this study demonstrates the need to extend the concept of ‘perceptual ranges’ beyond patch detection processes, to encompass the wide range of elements that can direct animal movements during dispersal through heterogeneous landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Pe’er","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Kramer-Schadt","given":"Stephanie"}],"container-title":"Ecological Modelling","container-title-short":"Ecological Modelling","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2007.11.020","ISSN":"0304-3800","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,4,24]]},"language":"en","page":"73-85","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Incorporating the perceptual range of animals into connectivity models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380007006199","volume":"213"},
  {"id":"peerSimpleProcessBasedSimulators2013","abstract":"Landscape simulators are widely applied in landscape ecology for generating landscape patterns. These models can be divided into two categories: pattern-based models that generate spatial patterns irrespective of the processes that shape them, and process-based models that attempt to generate patterns based on the processes that shape them. The latter often tend toward complexity in an attempt to obtain high predictive precision, but are rarely used for generic or theoretical purposes. Here we show that a simple process-based simulator can generate a variety of spatial patterns including realistic ones, typifying landscapes fragmented by anthropogenic activities. The model “G-RaFFe” generates roads and fields to reproduce the processes in which forests are converted into arable lands. For a selected level of habitat cover, three factors dominate its outcomes: the number of roads (accessibility), maximum field size (accounting for land ownership patterns), and maximum field disconnection (which enables field to be detached from roads). We compared the performance of G-RaFFe to three other models: Simmap (neutral model), Qrule (fractal-based) and Dinamica EGO (with 4 model versions differing in complexity). A PCA-based analysis indicated G-RaFFe and Dinamica version 4 (most complex) to perform best in matching realistic spatial patterns, but an alternative analysis which considers model variability identified G-RaFFe and Qrule as performing best. We also found model performance to be affected by habitat cover and the actual land-uses, the latter reflecting on land ownership patterns. We suggest that simple process-based generators such as G-RaFFe can be used to generate spatial patterns as templates for theoretical analyses, as well as for gaining better understanding of the relation between spatial processes and patterns. We suggest caution in applying neutral or fractal-based approaches, since spatial patterns that typify anthropogenic landscapes are often non-fractal in nature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Pe'er","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Zurita","given":"Gustavo A."},{"family":"Schober","given":"Lucia"},{"family":"Bellocq","given":"Maria I."},{"family":"Strer","given":"Maximilian"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Pütz","given":"Sandro"}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0064968","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,28]]},"language":"en","page":"e64968","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Simple Process-Based Simulators for Generating Spatial Patterns of Habitat Loss and Fragmentation: A Review and Introduction to the G-RaFFe Model","title-short":"Simple Process-Based Simulators for Generating Spatial Patterns of Habitat Loss and Fragmentation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064968","volume":"8"},

The evolutionary outcome is always complete philopatry by one sex. The rate of dispersal by the other sex depends on patch size and mating system, as well as inbreeding and dispersal costs. If such costs are sex independent, then two stable equilibria coexist (male or female philopatry), with symmetric domains of attraction. Which sex disperses is determined entirely by history, genetic drift, and gene flow. An asymmetry in costs makes one domain of attraction extend at the expense of the other. In such a case, the dispersing sex might also be, paradoxically, the one that incurs the higher dispersal costs. As asymmetry increases, one equilibrium eventually disappears, which may result in a sudden evolutionary shift in the identity of the dispersing sex. Our results underline the necessity to control for phylogenetic relationships (e.g., through the use of independent-comparisons methods) when investigating empirical trends in dispersal.

Mating systems have the potential to favor strong sex biases in dispersal because sex differences in potential reproductive success affect the balance between local resource competition and local mate competition. No bias is expected when local competition equally affects males and females, as happens in monogamous systems and also in polygynous or promiscuous ones as long as female fitness is limited by extrinsic factors (breeding resources). In contrast, a male-biased dispersal is predicted when local mate competition exceeds local resource competition, as happens under polygyny/promiscuity when female fitness is limited by intrinsic factors (maximal rate of processing resources rather than resources themselves). This bias is reinforced by among-sex interactions: female philopatry enhances breeding opportunities for related males, while male dispersal decreases the chances that related females will inbreed. These results meet empirical patterns in mammals: polygynous/promiscuous species usually display a male-biased dispersal, while both sexes disperse in monogamous species. A parallel is drawn with sex-ratio theory, which also predicts biases toward the sex that suffers less from local competition. Optimal sex ratios and optimal sex-specific dispersal show mutual dependence, which argues for the development of coevolution models.","author":[{"family":"Perrin","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Mazalov","given":"Vladimir"}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"Am Nat","DOI":"10.1086/303296","ISSN":"1537-5323","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"116-127","PMID":"10657181","source":"PubMed","title":"Local Competition, Inbreeding, and the Evolution of Sex-Biased Dispersal","type":"article-journal","volume":"155"},

We calculated carrying capacity based on the daily availability of mature flowers between January and December 1993 and the field energy requirements of bats as estimated from an equation for eutherian mammals (low estimate) and one for passerine birds (high estimate) based on body mass. Additional energy requirements of pregnancy and lactation were taken into account. We estimated that 461,172 columnar cacti were present on Curacao (38% Subpilocereus repandus, 51% Stenocereus griseus, and 11% Pilosocereus lanuginosus). May through September are the critical months when bats rely most heavily on cactus for food. July 1993 was a bottleneck with the smallest number of mature flowers per day. July and August were months of greatest energy demand because females were lactating. We estimate that the carrying capacity for Glossophaga longirostris in July, when the bat (Leptonycteris curasoae) population was 900, was near 1200, an estimate that fits the observed population size of nectar-feeding bats on the island.

  {"id":"phillipsLifehistoryEvolutionRangeshifting2010a","abstract":"Most evolutionary theory does not deal with populations expanding or contracting in space. Invasive species, climate change, epidemics, and the breakdown of dispersal barriers, however, all create populations in this kind of spatial disequilibrium. Importantly, spatial disequilibrium can have important ecological and evolutionary outcomes. During continuous range expansion, for example, populations on the expanding front experience novel evolutionary pressures because frontal populations are assorted by dispersal ability and have a lower density of conspecifics than do core populations. These conditions favor the evolution of traits that increase rates of dispersal and reproduction. Additionally, lowered density on the expanding front eventually frees populations on the expanding edge from specialist, coevolved enemies, permitting higher investment into traits associated with dispersal and reproduction rather than defense against pathogens. As a result, the process of range expansion drives rapid life-history evolution, and this seems to occur despite ongoing serial founder events that have complex effects on genetic diversity at the expanding front. Traits evolving on the expanding edge are smeared across the landscape as the front moves through, leaving an ephemeral signature of range expansion in the life-history traits of a species across its newly colonized range. Recent studies suggest that such nonequilibrium processes during recent population history may have contributed to many patterns usually ascribed to evolutionary forces acting in populations at spatial equilibrium.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Phillips","given":"Benjamin L."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Gregory P."},{"family":"Shine","given":"Richard"}],"container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1890/09-0910.1","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1890/09-0910.1","page":"1617-1627","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Life-history evolution in range-shifting populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/09-0910.1","volume":"91"},
  {"id":"phillipsRangeShiftPromotes2012","abstract":"Aim I investigate the counter-intuitive possibility that range shift promotes the formation of stable range edges. This might be expected because: (1) range-shifting populations typically evolve increased dispersal on the expanding range edge; (2) increased dispersal steepens the relative slope of environmental gradients (gradients appear steeper to a more dispersive population); and (3) environmental gradients that are steep relative to dispersal encourage the formation of stable range edges (when gradients appear steep, adaptation on the range edge is swamped by maladapted genes). Methods I test the idea that populations take longer to evolve across an environmental gradient when those populations have already undergone a period of spread. I do this using an individual-based coupled map lattice simulation, in which individuals carry heritable traits for dispersal probability and environment-specific fitness. Results Numerous simulations across parameter space confirm that a period of range shift almost always results in a longer time to evolve through an environmental gradient. This occurs because of both the mechanism described above and the erosion of adaptive variation resulting from the serial foundering that occurs during range advance. Main conclusions This result suggests that species may often shift their range due to intrinsic changes in the population rather than extrinsic changes in the environment. The result also suggests a new mechanism regulating the speed of invasion, and sounds a cautionary note for climate change impacts: the longer a species tracks climate change, the less able it may be to track that change into the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Phillips","given":"Ben L."}],"container-title":"Journal of Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02597.x","ISSN":"1365-2699","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02597.x","page":"153-161","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Range shift promotes the formation of stable range edges","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02597.x","volume":"39"},

Using a spatially explicit individual-based model, we demonstrate this effect under a wide variety of population growth rates and dispersal costs. We then test the possibility of an evolved shift in dispersal kernels by measuring dispersal rates in individual cane toads (Bufo marinus) from invasive populations in Australia (historically, toads advanced their range at 10 km/year, but now they achieve >55 km/year in the northern part of their range). Under a common-garden design, we found a steady increase in dispersal tendency with distance from the invasion origin. Dispersal kernels on the invading front were less kurtotic and less skewed than those from origin populations.

Species simulated by CAPS differ in habitat preferences (niche width), dispersal of propagules, and relative fecundity. The spatial distribution of habitat types are represented as heterogeneous gridded landscapes. The outcome of competition and establishment processes in successive generations is determined locally via a seed lottery. A series of 200 year-long simulations was performed to investigate the effects of variation in species characteristics and competition, landscape heterogeneity, and disturbance on patterns of species abundances. The outcome of competition was most sensitive to differences in fecundity between species, the spatial distribution of suitable habitat and the initial distribution of species. Species with a narrow niche were confined to a single habitat type and remained at or near their initialization sites. Broader niches resulted in increasing niche overlap and competition but enhanced species mobility, allowing abundance levels to approach expected values determined by map resources. Even so, initial distributions still affected the spatial patterns of species distributions at year 200. Disturbance regimes were simulated by varying the frequency, extent and spatial pattern of disturbances. Disturbance events removed species from affected sites but did not otherwise alter habitat characteristics. Results showed that disturbances may lead to a reversal in competition and establishment, dependent on species-specific differences in fecundity and dispersal. Although intermediate levels of disturbance frequency and extent increased the probability of species coexistence, the spatial pattern of disturbance played an unexpectedly important role in the tradeoff between dispersal and fecundity. The ability to simulate multiple factors affecting patterns of persistence, abundance and spatial distribution of species provided by CAPS allows new insight into the temporal and spatial patterns of community development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Plotnick","given":"Roy E"},{"family":"Gardner","given":"Robert H"}],"container-title":"Ecological Modelling","container-title-short":"Ecological Modelling","DOI":"10.1016/S0304-3800(01)00418-5","ISSN":"0304-3800","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,1,15]]},"language":"en","page":"171-197","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A general model for simulating the effects of landscape heterogeneity and disturbance on community patterns","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380001004185","volume":"147"},

Our simulations show that individuals following an informed strategy, where emigration (and settlement) probability depends on local population density, evolve a lower (natal) emigration propensity but disperse over significantly larger distances - i.e. postpone settlement longer - than individuals performing density-independent emigration. This holds especially when variation in environmental conditions is spatially correlated.

We performed a number of spatially explicit, individual‐based simulation experiments to test these predictions and to explore further the relevance of variation in the rate of population increase, density dependence, environmental fluctuations and dispersal mortality on the evolution of dispersal rates. They confirm the predictions of our analytical approach. In addition, they show that dispersal rates in metapopulations mostly depend on dispersal mortality and inter‐patch variation in population density. The latter is dominantly driven by environmental fluctuations and the rate of population increase. These conclusions are not altered by the introduction of neighbourhood dispersal.

  {"id":"poyrySpeciesTraitsExplain2009","abstract":"This study provides a novel systematic comparative analysis of the species characteristics affecting the range margin shifts in butterflies towards higher latitudes, while taking phylogenetic relatedness among species into account. We related observed changes in the northern range margins of 48 butterfly species in Finland between two time periods (1992–1996 and 2000–2004) to 11 species traits. Species with positive records in at least ten 10 km × 10 km grid squares (in the Finnish National Butterfly Recording Scheme, NAFI) in both periods were included in the study. When corrected for range size change, the 48 butterfly species had shifted their range margins northwards on average by 59.9 km between the study periods, with maximum shifts of over 300 km for three species. This rate of range shifts exceeds all previously reported records worldwide. Our findings may be explained by two factors: the study region is situated in higher latitudes than in most previous studies and it focuses on the period of most prominent warming during the last 10–15 years. Several species traits exhibited a significant univariate relationship with the range margin shift according to generalized estimation equations (GEE) taking into account the phylogenetic relatedness among species. Nonthreatened butterflies had on average expanded their ranges strongly northwards (84.5 km), whereas the distributions of threatened species were stationary (−2.1 km). Hierarchical partitioning (HP) analysis indicated that mobile butterflies living in forest edges and using woody plants as their larval hosts exhibited largest range shifts towards the north. Thus, habitat availability and dispersal capacity of butterfly species are likely to determine whether they will be successful in shifting their ranges in response to the warming climate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Pöyry","given":"Juha"},{"family":"Luoto","given":"Miska"},{"family":"Heikkinen","given":"Risto K."},{"family":"Kuussaari","given":"Mikko"},{"family":"Saarinen","given":"Kimmo"}],"container-title":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01789.x","ISSN":"1365-2486","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01789.x","page":"732-743","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Species traits explain recent range shifts of Finnish butterflies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01789.x","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"revillaEffectsMatrixHeterogeneity2004","abstract":"Mounting theoretical and empirical evidence shows that matrix heterogeneity may have contrasting effects on metapopulation dynamics by contributing to patch isolation in nontrivial ways. We analyze the movement properties during interpatch dispersal in a metapopulation of Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus). On a daily temporal scale, lynx habitat selection defines two types of matrix habitats where individuals may move: open and dispersal habitats (avoided and used as available, respectively). There was a strong and complex impact of matrix heterogeneity on movement properties at several temporal scales (hourly and daily radiolocations and the entire dispersal event). We use the movement properties on the hourly temporal scale to build a simulation model to reconstruct individual dispersal events. The two most important parameters affecting model predictions at both the individual (daily) and metapopulation scales were related to the movement capacity (number of movement steps per day and autocorrelation in dispersal habitat) followed by the parameters representing the habitat selection in the matrix. The model adequately reproduced field estimates of population‐level parameters (e.g., interpatch connectivity, maximum and final dispersal distances), and its performance was clearly improved when including the effect of matrix heterogeneity on movement properties. To assume there is a homogeneous matrix results in large errors in the estimate of interpatch connectivity, especially for close patches separated by open habitat or corridors of dispersal habitat, showing how important it is to consider matrix heterogeneity when it is present. Movement properties affect the interaction of dispersing individuals with the landscape and can be used as a mechanistic representation of dispersal at the metapopulation level. This is so when the effect of matrix heterogeneity on movement properties is evaluated under biologically meaningful spatial and temporal scales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Revilla","given":"Eloy"},{"family":"Wiegand","given":"Thorsten"},{"family":"Palomares","given":"Francisco"},{"family":"Ferreras","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Delibes","given":"Miguel"}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/424767","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,11,1]]},"page":"E130-E153","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Effects of Matrix Heterogeneity on Animal Dispersal: From Individual Behavior to Metapopulation‐Level Parameters.","title-short":"Effects of Matrix Heterogeneity on Animal Dispersal","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/424767","volume":"164"},

The available theory describes the latter with simple distance-dependent functions that depend on landscape properties such as interpatch distance or patch size. Despite its potential role, we lack a good mechanistic understanding of how the movement of individuals between patches affects the dynamics of these populations. We used the theoretical framework provided by movement ecology to make a direct representation of the processes determining how individuals connect local populations in a spatially structured population of Iberian lynx. Interpatch processes depended on the heterogeneity of the matrix where patches are embedded and the parameters defining individual movement behavior. They were also very sensitive to the dynamic demographic variables limiting the time moving, the within-patch dynamics of available settlement sites (both spatiotemporally heterogeneous) and the response of individuals to the perceived risk while moving. These context-dependent dynamic factors are an inherent part of the movement process, producing connectivities and dispersal kernels whose variability is affected by other demographic processes. Mechanistic representations of interpatch movements, such as the one provided by the movement-ecology framework, permit the dynamic interaction of birth–death processes and individual movement behavior, thus improving our understanding of stochastic spatially structured populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Revilla","given":"Eloy"},{"family":"Wiegand","given":"Thorsten"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0801725105","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"49","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,12,9]]},"language":"en","page":"19120-19125","PMID":"19060193","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Research Article","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Individual movement behavior, matrix heterogeneity, and the dynamics of spatially structured populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/105/49/19120","volume":"105"},

Patch isolation, a crucial parameter to the predictions of island biogeography and metapopulation theories, is measured by distance alone. To test whether the type of interpatch matrix can contribute significantly to patch isolation, I conducted a mark-recapture study on a butterfly community inhabiting meadows in a naturally patchy landscape. I used maximum likelihood to estimate the relative resistances of the two major matrix types (willow thicket and conifer forest) to butterfly movement between meadow patches. For four of the six butterfly taxa (subfamilies or tribes) studied, conifer was 3-12 times more resistant than willow. For the two remaining taxa (the most vagile and least vagile in the community), resistance estimates for willow and conifer were not significantly different, indicating that responses to matrix differ even among closely related species. These results suggest that the surrounding matrix can significantly influence the \"effective isolation\" of habitat patches, rendering them more or less isolated than simple distance or classic models would indicate. Modification of the matrix may provide opportunities for reducing patch isolation and thus the extinction risk of populations in fragmented landscapes.","author":[{"family":"Ricketts","given":"T.

  {"id":"ripaNoiseColourRisk1996","abstract":"A recurrent problem in ecology and conservation biology is to estimate the risk of population extinctions. Extinction probabilities are not only imperative for conservation and management, but may also elucidate basic mechanisms of the regulation of natural populations (Burgman et al. 1993; Pimm 1994). The usual way of modelling stochastic influence on population dynamics has been to assume that the external noise is uncorrelated. This means that each and every randomly drawn noise value is totally independent on previous ones. This is what is generally called ‘white’ noise. However, the noise itself can be temporally autocorrelated. That is, the values of the random numbers used in the noise process will depend on previous ones. Here we show that the autocorrelation, or colour, of the external noise assumed to influence population dynamics strongly modifies estimated extinction probabilities. For positively autocorrelated (‘red’) noise, the risk of extinction clearly decreases the stronger the autocorrelation is, Negatively autocorrelated (‘blue’) noise is more ambiguously related to extinction probability. Thus, the commonly assumed white noise in population modelling will severely bias population extinction risk estimates. Moreover, the extinction probability estimates are also significantly dependent on model structure which calls for a cautious use of traditional discrete-time models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Ripa","given":"Jörgen"},{"family":"Lundberg","given":"Per"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

We consider in turn the long-term effects of a change in the local disturbance rate, in the maximal local population persistence, in habitat productivity, and in habitat fragmentation. We examine the consequences of selective interactions between dispersal and reproductive effort by comparing the outcome of joint evolution to a situation where the species has lost the potential to evolve either its reproductive effort or its dispersal rate. We relax the classical assumption that any occupied site in the metapopulation reaches its carrying capacity immediately after recolonization. Our main conclusions are the following: (1) genetic diversity modifies the range of landscape parameters for which the metapopulation is viable, but it alters very little the qualitative evolutionary trends observed for each trait within this range. Although they are both part of a competition/colonization axis, reproductive effort and dispersal are not substitutable traits: their evolution reflects more directly the change in the landscape dynamics, than a selective interaction among them. (2) no general syndrome of covariation between reproductive effort and dispersal can be predicted: the pattern of association between the two traits depends on the type of change in landscape dynamics and on the saturation level.

This cost-benefit argument has heuristic value and facilitates the comprehension of results obtained numerically. In particular, it explains why some minimal or maximal probability of dispersal may evolve at intermediate distances when the cost of dispersal function is an increasing function of distance.

The other reason is that fractals are simple to generate on computers.

It facilitates the propagation of beneficial alleles throughout the distributional range of spatially outspread populations and increases the speed of adaptation. However, when habitat is heterogeneous and individuals are locally adapted, dispersal may, at the same time, reduce fitness through increasing maladaptation. Here, we use a spatially explicit, allelic simulation model to quantify how these equivocal effects of dispersal affect a population's evolutionary response to changing climate. Individuals carry a diploid set of chromosomes, with alleles coding for adaptation to non-climatic environmental conditions and climatic conditions, respectively. Our model results demonstrate that the interplay between gene flow and habitat heterogeneity may decrease effective dispersal and population size to such an extent that substantially reduces the likelihood of evolutionary rescue. Importantly, even when evolutionary rescue saves a population from extinction, its spatial range following climate change may be strongly narrowed, that is, the rescue is only partial. These findings emphasize that neglecting the impact of non-climatic, local adaptation might lead to a considerable overestimation of a population's evolvability under rapid environmental change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Schiffers","given":"Katja"},{"family":"Bourne","given":"Elizabeth C."},{"family":"Lavergne","given":"Sébastien"},{"family":"Thuiller","given":"Wilfried"},{"family":"Travis","given":"Justin M.

  {"id":"schtickzelleDispersalDepressionHabitat2006","abstract":"Habitat fragmentation is expected to impose strong selective pressures on dispersal rates. However, evolutionary responses of dispersal are not self-evident, since various selection pressures act in opposite directions. Here we disentangled the components of dispersal behavior in a metapopulation context using the Virtual Migration model, and we linked their variation to habitat fragmentation in the specialist butterfly Proclossiana eunomia. Our study provided a nearly unique opportunity to study how habitat fragmentation modifies dispersal at the landscape scale, as opposed to microlandscapes or simulation studies. Indeed, we studied the same species in four landscapes with various habitat fragmentation levels, in which large amounts of field data were collected and analyzed using similar methodologies. We showed the existence of quantitative variations in dispersal behavior correlated with increased fragmentation. Dispersal propensity from habitat patches (for a given patch size), and mortality during dispersal (for a given patch connectivity) were lower in more fragmented landscapes. We suggest that these were the consequences of two different evolutionary responses of dispersal behavior at the individual level: (1) when fragmentation increased, the reluctance of individuals to cross habitat patch boundaries also increased; (2) when individuals dispersed, they flew straighter in the matrix, which is the best strategy to improve dispersal success. Such evolutionary responses could generate complex nonlinear patterns of dispersal changes at the metapopulation level according to habitat fragmentation. Due to the small size and increased isolation of habitat patches in fragmented landscapes, overall emigration rate and mortality during dispersal remained high. As a consequence, successful dispersal at the metapopulation scale remained limited. Therefore, to what extent the selection of individuals with a lower dispersal propensity and a higher survival during dispersal is able to limit detrimental effects of habitat fragmentation on dispersal success is unknown, and any conclusion that metapopulations would compensate for them is flawed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Schtickzelle","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Mennechez","given":"Gwénaëlle"},{"family":"Baguette","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Mennechez","given":"Gwénnaëlle"}],"container-title":"Ecology","ISSN":"0012-9658","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"page":"1057-1065","publisher":"Ecological Society of America","source":"JSTOR","title":"Dispersal Depression with Habitat Fragmentation in the Bog Fritillary Butterfly","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/20069035","volume":"87"},

We measured the butterfly's tendency to move toward habitat patches (bias) and their tendency to continue to move in the direction they were already going (correlation). We found that butterflies significantly modify their behavior within 10-22 m from the habitat boundary. We used these data to predict large scale patterns of residence time as a function of patch size, using three dispersal models: homogeneous response to habitat, heterogeneous response to habitat, and heterogeneous response to habitat with edge-mediated behavior. We simulated movement for males and females in eight patch sizes (0.1-8 ha) and asked how residence time varies among the models. We found that adding edge-mediated behavior significantly increases the residence of Fender's blue butterflies in their natal patch.

  {"id":"schurrHowUnderstandSpecies2012","abstract":"Range dynamics causes mismatches between a species’ geographical distribution and the set of suitable environments in which population growth is positive (the Hutchinsonian niche). This is because source–sink population dynamics cause species to occupy unsuitable environments, and because environmental change creates non-equilibrium situations in which species may be absent from suitable environments (due to migration limitation) or present in unsuitable environments that were previously suitable (due to time-delayed extinction). Because correlative species distribution models do not account for these processes, they are likely to produce biased niche estimates and biased forecasts of future range dynamics. Recently developed dynamic range models (DRMs) overcome this problem: they statistically estimate both range dynamics and the underlying environmental response of demographic rates from species distribution data. This process-based statistical approach qualitatively advances biogeographical analyses. Yet, the application of DRMs to a broad range of species and study systems requires substantial research efforts in statistical modelling, empirical data collection and ecological theory. Here we review current and potential contributions of these fields to a demographic understanding of niches and range dynamics. Our review serves to formulate a demographic research agenda that entails: (1) advances in incorporating process-based models of demographic responses and range dynamics into a statistical framework, (2) systematic collection of data on temporal changes in distribution and abundance and on the response of demographic rates to environmental variation, and (3) improved theoretical understanding of the scaling of demographic rates and the dynamics of spatially coupled populations. This demographic research agenda is challenging but necessary for improved comprehension and quantification of niches and range dynamics. It also forms the basis for understanding how niches and range dynamics are shaped by evolutionary dynamics and biotic interactions. Ultimately, the demographic research agenda should lead to deeper integration of biogeography with empirical and theoretical ecology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Schurr","given":"Frank M."},{"family":"Pagel","given":"Jörn"},{"family":"Cabral","given":"Juliano Sarmento"},{"family":"Groeneveld","given":"Jürgen"},{"family":"Bykova","given":"Olga"},{"family":"O’Hara","given":"Robert B."},{"family":"Hartig","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Kissling","given":"W.

It is still debated whether and under which conditions red noise increases or decreases extinction risk compared with uncorrelated (white) noise. Here, we explain the opposing effects by introducing two features of red noise time series. On the one hand, positive autocorrelation increases the probability of series of poor environmental conditions, implying increasing extinction risk. On the other hand, for a given time period, the probability of at least one extremely bad year (\"catastrophe\") is reduced compared with white noise, implying decreasing extinction risk. Which of these two features determines extinction risk depends on the strength of environmental fluctuations and the sensitivity of population dynamics to these fluctuations. If extreme (catastrophic) events can occur (strong noise) or sensitivity is high (overcompensatory density dependence), then temporal correlation decreases extinction risk; otherwise, it increases it. Thus, our results provide a simple explanation for the contrasting previous findings and are a crucial step toward a general understanding of the effect of noise color on extinction risk.","author":[{"family":"Schwager","given":"Monika"},{"family":"Johst","given":"Karin"},{"family":"Jeltsch","given":"Florian"}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"Am Nat","DOI":"10.1086/503609","ISSN":"1537-5323","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,6]]},"language":"eng","page":"879-888","PMID":"16615033","source":"PubMed","title":"Does red noise increase or decrease extinction risk?

These initiatives are reliant on modelling processes, largely underpinned by metapopulation models. We argue that generic models developed for individual species in particular landscapes over selected time periods may only be applicable to alternative landscapes and time periods in restricted circumstances. Variability in species responses to landscapes and environmental conditions is dependent on a range of species-specific intrinsic characteristics, dependent on their responses to resources, (including weather) and also individual states. We propose that the behavioural component of how species respond to resources needs to be taken into account in modelling species responses to landscape, and therefore how limited resources for conservation are deployed. Species behaviours are inherently complex. We argue that because of this complexity the conservation of the majority of species, especially of the least rare, may be best served if conservation effort is additionally focused on increasing landscape heterogeneity and disturbance. This may also facilitate persistence in the face of climate change. We suggest that heterogeneity should be promoted through agri-environment schemes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Shreeve","given":"T.

  {"id":"simmonsChangesDispersalSpecies2004","abstract":"Explanations for rapid species' range expansions have typically been purely ecological, with little attention given to evolutionary processes. We tested predictions for the evolution of dispersal during range expansion using four species of wing-dimorphic bush cricket (Conocephalus discolor, Conocephalus dorsalis, Metrioptera roeselii, and Metrioptera brachyptera). We observed distinct changes in dispersal in the two species with expanding ranges. Recently colonized populations at the range margin showed increased frequencies of dispersive, long-winged (macropterous) individuals, compared with longer-established populations in the range core. This increase in dispersal appeared to be short-lived because 5-10 years after colonization populations showed similar incidences of macroptery to populations in the range core. These changes are consistent with evolutionary change; field patterns persisted when nymphs were reared under controlled environmental conditions, and range margin individuals reared in the laboratory flew farther than range core individuals in a wind tunnel. There was also a reproductive trade-off with dispersal in both females and males, which could explain the rapid reversion to lower rates of dispersal once populations become established. The effect of population density on wing morphology differed between populations from the range core (no significant effect of density) and expanding range margins (negative density dependence), which we propose is part of the mechanism of the changes in dispersal. Transient changes in dispersal are likely to be common in many species undergoing range expansion and can have major population and biogeographic consequences.","author":[{"family":"Simmons","given":"Adam D."},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Chris D."}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"Am Nat","DOI":"10.1086/423430","ISSN":"1537-5323","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,9]]},"language":"eng","page":"378-395","PMID":"15478092","source":"PubMed","title":"Changes in dispersal during species' range expansions","type":"article-journal","volume":"164"},

  {"id":"singerInterspecificInteractionsAffect2013","abstract":"The response of individual species to climate change may alter the composition and dynamics of communities. Here, we show that the impacts of environmental change on communities can depend on the nature of the interspecific interactions: mutualistic communities typically respond differently than commensalistic or parasitic communities. We model and analyse the geographic range shifting of metapopulations of two interacting species – a host and an obligate species. Different types of interspecific interactions are implemented by modifying local extinction rates according to the presence/absence of the other species. We distinguish and compare three fundamentally different community types: mutualism, commensalism and parasitism. We find that community dynamics during geographic range shifting critically depends on the type of interspecific interactions. Parasitic interactions exacerbate the negative effect of environmental change whereas mutualistic interactions only partly compensate it. Commensalistic interactions exhibit an intermediate response. Based on these model outcomes, we predict that parasitic species interactions may be more vulnerable to geographic range shifting than commensalistic or mutualistic ones. However, we observe that when climate stabilises following a period of change, the rate of community recovery is largely independent of the type of interspecific interactions. These results emphasize that communities respond delicately to environmental change, and that local interspecific interactions can affect range shifting communities at large spatial scales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Singer","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Travis","given":"Justin M.

  {"id":"spearUseResistanceSurfaces2010","abstract":"Measures of genetic structure among individuals or populations collected at different spatial locations across a landscape are commonly used as surrogate measures of functional (i.e. demographic or genetic) connectivity. In order to understand how landscape characteristics influence functional connectivity, resistance surfaces are typically created in a raster GIS environment. These resistance surfaces represent hypothesized relationships between landscape features and gene flow, and are based on underlying biological functions such as relative abundance or movement probabilities in different land cover types. The biggest challenge for calculating resistance surfaces is assignment of resistance values to different landscape features. Here, we first identify study objectives that are consistent with the use of resistance surfaces and critically review the various approaches that have been used to parameterize resistance surfaces and select optimal models in landscape genetics. We then discuss the biological assumptions and considerations that influence analyses using resistance surfaces, such as the relationship between gene flow and dispersal, how habitat suitability may influence animal movement, and how resistance surfaces can be translated into estimates of functional landscape connectivity. Finally, we outline novel approaches for creating optimal resistance surfaces using either simulation or computational methods, as well as alternatives to resistance surfaces (e.g. network and buffered paths). These approaches have the potential to improve landscape genetic analyses, but they also create new challenges. We conclude that no single way of using resistance surfaces is appropriate for every situation. We suggest that researchers carefully consider objectives, important biological assumptions and available parameterization and validation techniques when planning landscape genetic studies.","author":[{"family":"Spear","given":"Stephen F."},{"family":"Balkenhol","given":"Niko"},{"family":"Fortin","given":"Marie-Josée"},{"family":"McRae","given":"Brad H."},{"family":"Scribner","given":"Kim"}],"container-title":"Molecular Ecology","container-title-short":"Mol Ecol","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04657.x","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,9]]},"language":"eng","page":"3576-3591","PMID":"20723064","source":"PubMed","title":"Use of resistance surfaces for landscape genetic studies: considerations for parameterization and analysis","title-short":"Use of resistance surfaces for landscape genetic studies","type":"article-journal","volume":"19"},

Juvenile Anolis aeneus lizards arriving at juvenile habitats in clearings were given a choice of artificial homesites arranged around a clear-walled enclosure divided into two parts, one of which contained resident A. aeneus juveniles. Juveniles showed a clear preference for the homesites adjacent to the established territorial residents (the \"experimental\" homesites). In each of eight trials, the first arrivals appeared on the experimental homesites. Juveniles that first appeared on the experimental homesites were more apt to settle in the clearing, and colonists on the experimental side moved around less before choosing a final territory. During the colonization process, juveniles spent more time on the experimental sides of the enclosures; and by the end of the trials, more juveniles had eventually settled on the experimental homesites. Throughout the settlement process, new territory owners tended to cluster around the previous residents within the experimental side of the enclosures.

Habitat selection by dispersers can be divided into three stages (search, settlement and residency); recent studies suggest that the adaptive significance of behaviour at each of these stages may differ from the assumptions of traditional habitat selection theory. For instance, dispersers may benefit from the presence of conspecifics or heterospecifics while searching for, settling in, or living in new habitats, and individuals may prefer to settle in post-dispersal habitats similar to their pre-dispersal habitats, because this behaviour reduces the costs of detecting or assessing suitable habitats (habitat cuing) or because experience in a pre-dispersal habitat improves performance if an animal settles in the same type of habitat after dispersing (habitat training). Dispersers have evolved a variety of proximate behavioural mechanisms to reduce search and settlement costs in natural environments, but if they currently rely on these processes, species living in areas modified by human activities may not exhibit 'ideal' habitat selection behaviour.

We developed a Bayesian model to study how different types of experience in the natal habitat and survival to the age/stage of dispersal interact to affect a disperser’s estimate of the quality of new natal‐type habitats. The model predicts that the types of experience a disperser had before leaving its natal habitat will affect the attractiveness of cues from new natal‐type habitats and that favorable experiences will increase the level of preference for natal‐type habitats more than unfavorable experiences will decrease it. An experimental study of NHPI in Drosophila melanogaster provided with “good” and “bad” experiences in their natal habitats supports these predictions while also indicating that the effects of different types of natal experience on NHPI vary across genotypes. If habitat preferences are modulated by an individual’s experience before dispersal as described in this study, then NHPI may have stronger effects on sympatric speciation, metapopulation dynamics, conservation biology, and pest management than previously supposed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Stamps","given":"Judy A."},{"family":"Krishnan","given":"V. V."},{"family":"Willits","given":"Neil H."},{"family":"Ketterson","given":"Associate Editor: Ellen D."},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Editor: Ruth G."}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/644526","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"623-630","publisher":"[The University of Chicago Press, The American Society of Naturalists]","source":"JSTOR","title":"How Different Types of Natal Experience Affect Habitat Preference","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/644526","volume":"174"},

We explore how habitat selection behavior is affected by the risk of mortality en route and by deferred search costs (i.e., costs incurred during search that reduce fitness after arrival in the new habitat), using a model designed for long-distance natal dispersers searching for scarce patches of suitable habitat embedded within a matrix of unsuitable habitat. In this situation, increases in the risk of mortality during search reduce disperser selectivity, where selectivity is reflected by the period during search when dispersers are only willing to accept a high-quality habitat. However, the effects of deferred costs on selectivity depend on other factors with pronounced effects on selectivity, including encounter rates with high-quality habitats, relative habitat quality, and total search time. Surprisingly, under some sets of conditions, increases in deferred costs lead to increases in disperser selectivity. Overall, the effects of mortality and deferred costs on selectivity are small relative to the effects of other factors on selectivity. For instance, our model suggests that selectivity is much more strongly affected by total search time than by search costs, and it predicts a positive relationship between total search time and disperser selectivity across individuals in the same population, even in the face of considerable inter-individual variation in risk of mortality or deferred search costs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Stamps","given":"Judy A."},{"family":"Krishnan","given":"V.

  {"id":"starrfeltParentoffspringConflictEvolution2010","abstract":"Parent-offspring conflict emerges in many different contexts, but a rarely emphasized perspective is that of space as a resource that is allocated or acquired through dispersal. Early theoretical work has shown that there are different optima in rates of dispersal between parents and offspring. Here we examine this principle when space is explicitly modeled and dispersal is achieved through a dispersal kernel. We find a consistent pattern that selection favors longer dispersal distances under maternal control of dispersal (e.g., maternal tissue surrounding a seed) compared with scenarios where offspring themselves control dispersal (as in many animals). Intriguingly, offspring control leads to better resource utilization (higher habitat occupancy) in equilibrium scenarios than does maternal control. In contrast, in species that expand their ranges, maternal control of dispersal initially leads to faster range expansion. If there is evolutionary potential for dispersal kernels to change at the leading edge of a population, this difference vanishes quickly during an invasion because offspring-controlled dispersal evolves faster and catches up with scenarios involving maternal control. There is thus less conflict in nonequilibrium scenarios. In invasive scenarios with an evolving kernel shape, disruptive selection against intermediate distances can make the kernel not only fat-tailed but also bimodal.","author":[{"family":"Starrfelt","given":"Jostein"},{"family":"Kokko","given":"Hanna"}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"Am Nat","DOI":"10.1086/648605","ISSN":"1537-5323","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"38-49","PMID":"19911910","source":"PubMed","title":"Parent-offspring conflict and the evolution of dispersal distance","type":"article-journal","volume":"175"},

The prevalence of dispersal in rapidly expanding populations is held to be the best evidence for presaturation dispersal. Because dispersal reduces the growth rate of source populations, it is generally believed that emigration is not balanced by immigration, and that mortality of emigrants occurs as a result of movement into a 'sink' of unfavourable habitat. If such dispersal is age- or sex-biased, the demo­ graphy of the population is markedly affected, as a consequence of differ­ ences in mortality in the dispersive sex or age class. Habitat heterogeneity consequently underlies this interpretation of dispersal and its demographic consequences, although the spatial variability of environments is rarely assessed in dispersal studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"DOI":"10.1007/978-94-011-2338-9","editor":[{"family":"Stenseth","given":"N.

However, connectivity estimates have rarely been validated by the observation of dispersal movements. In this study, we estimated functional connectivity of a real landscape by modelling dispersal for the endangered natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) using cost distance. Cost distance allows the evaluation of 'effective distances', which are distances corrected for the costs involved in moving between habitat patches in spatially explicit landscapes. We parameterized cost-distance models using the results of our previous experimental investigation of natterjack's movement behaviour. These model predictions (connectivity estimates from the GIS study) were then confronted to genetic-based dispersal rates between natterjack populations in the same landscape using Mantel tests. Dispersal rates between the populations were inferred from variation at six microsatellite loci. Based on these results, we conclude that matrix structure has a strong effect on dispersal rates. Moreover, we found that cost distances generated by habitat preferences explained dispersal rates better than did the Euclidian distances, or the connectivity estimate based on patch-specific resistances (patch viscosity). This study is a clear example of how landscape genetics can validate operational functional connectivity estimates.","author":[{"family":"Stevens","given":"Virginie M."},{"family":"Verkenne","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Vandewoestijne","given":"Sofie"},{"family":"Wesselingh","given":"Renate A."},{"family":"Baguette","given":"Michel"}],"container-title":"Molecular Ecology","container-title-short":"Mol Ecol","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.02936.x","ISSN":"0962-1083","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,8]]},"language":"eng","page":"2333-2344","PMID":"16842409","source":"PubMed","title":"Gene flow and functional connectivity in the natterjack toad","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"stevensMetaanalysisDispersalButterflies2010","abstract":"Dispersal has recently gained much attention because of its crucial role in the conservation and evolution of species facing major environmental changes such as habitat loss and fragmentation, climate change, and their interactions. Butterflies have long been recognized as ideal model systems for the study of dispersal and a huge amount of data on their ability to disperse has been collected under various conditions. However, no single ‘best’ method seems to exist leading to the co-occurrence of various approaches to study butterfly mobility, and therefore a high heterogeneity among data on dispersal across this group. Accordingly, we here reviewed the knowledge accumulated on dispersal and mobility in butterflies, to detect general patterns. This meta-analysis specifically addressed two questions. Firstly, do the various methods provide a congruent picture of how dispersal ability is distributed across species? Secondly, is dispersal species-specific? Five sources of data were analysed: multisite mark-recapture experiments, genetic studies, experimental assessments, expert opinions, and transect surveys. We accounted for potential biases due to variation in genetic markers, sample sizes, spatial scales or the level of habitat fragmentation. We showed that the various dispersal estimates generally converged, and that the relative dispersal ability of species could reliably be predicted from their relative vagrancy (records of butterflies outside their normal habitat). Expert opinions gave much less reliable estimates of realized dispersal but instead reflected migration propensity of butterflies. Within-species comparisons showed that genetic estimates were relatively invariable, while other dispersal estimates were highly variable. This latter point questions dispersal as a species-specific, invariant trait.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Stevens","given":"Virginie M."},{"family":"Turlure","given":"Camille"},{"family":"Baguette","given":"Michel"}],"container-title":"Biological Reviews","DOI":"10.1111/j.1469-185X.2009.00119.x","ISSN":"1469-185X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2009.00119.x","page":"625-642","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A meta-analysis of dispersal in butterflies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2009.00119.x","volume":"85"},
  {"id":"stevensQuantifyingFunctionalConnectivity2006","abstract":"Like other pond-breeding amphibians, the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) typically presents a patchy distribution. Because the species experiences high probabilities of local population extinction, its persistence within landscapes relies on both local and landscape-scale processes [dispersal allowing the (re)colonization of habitat patches]. However, the structure and composition of the matrix surrounding local populations can alter the dispersal rates between populations. As shown previously (Landscape Ecol 19:829–842, 2004), the locomotor performances of individuals at the dispersal stage depend on the nature of the component crossed: some landscape components offer high resistance to movement (high resistance or high viscosity components) whereas others allow high efficiency of movement (low resistance components). We now examine the ability of individuals to discriminate between landscape components and select low-resistance components. Our experimental study investigates the ways in which young natterjack toads choose from among landscape components common to southern Belgium. Toadlets (the dispersal stage) were experimentally confronted with boundaries between surrogates of sandy soils, roads, forests, agricultural fields and intensive pastures. Our results show: 1 the ability of toadlets to react to boundaries between landscape components, 2 differences in permeability among boundaries, and 3 our inability to predict correctly the permeability of the boundaries from the patch-specific resistance assessed previously. Toadlets showed a preference for bare environments and forests, whereas they avoided the use of agricultural environments. This pattern could not be explained in terms of patch-specific resistance only, and is discussed in terms of mortality risks and resource availability in the various landscape components, with particular attention to repercussions on conservation strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Stevens","given":"Virginie M."},{"family":"Leboulengé","given":"Éric"},{"family":"Wesselingh","given":"Renate A."},{"family":"Baguette","given":"Michel"}],"container-title":"Oecologia","container-title-short":"Oecologia","DOI":"10.1007/s00442-006-0500-6","ISSN":"1432-1939","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"161-171","source":"Springer Link","title":"Quantifying functional connectivity: experimental assessment of boundary permeability for the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita)","title-short":"Quantifying functional connectivity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-006-0500-6","volume":"150"},
  {"id":"thomasClimateClimateChange2010","abstract":"Aim A major issue in ecology, biogeography, conservation biology and invasion biology is the extent to which climate, and hence climate change, contributes to the positions of species’ range boundaries. Thirty years of rapid climate warming provides an excellent opportunity to test the hypothesis that climate acts as a major constraint on range boundaries, treating anthropogenic climate change as a large-scale experiment. Location UK and global data, and literature. Methods This article analyses the frequencies with which species have responded to climate change by shifting their range boundaries. It does not consider abundance or other changes. Results For the majority of species, boundaries shifted in a direction that is concordant with being a response to climate change; 84% of all species have expanded in a polewards direction as the climate has warmed (for the best data available), which represents an excess of 68% of species after taking account of the fact that some species may shift in this direction for non-climatic reasons. Other data sets also show an excess of animal range boundaries expanding in the expected direction. Main conclusions Climate is likely to contribute to the majority of terrestrial and freshwater range boundaries. This generalization excludes species that are endemic to specific islands, lakes, rivers and geological outcrops, although these local endemics are not immune from the effects of climate change. The observed shifts associated with recent climate change are likely to have been brought about through both direct and indirect (changes to species’ interactions) effects of climate; indirect effects are discussed in relation to laboratory experiments and invasive species. Recent observations of range boundary shifts are consistent with the hypothesis that climate contributes to, but is not the sole determinant of, the position of the range boundaries of the majority of terrestrial animal species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Thomas","given":"Chris D."}],"container-title":"Diversity and Distributions","DOI":"10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00642.x","ISSN":"1472-4642","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00642.x","page":"488-495","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Climate, climate change and range boundaries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00642.x","volume":"16"},

Increasing impacts are expected for the future, yet few studies have aimed for a general understanding of the regional basis for species vulnerability. We projected late 21st century distributions for 1,350 European plants species under seven climate change scenarios. Application of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List criteria to our projections shows that many European plant species could become severely threatened. More than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080. Expected species loss and turnover per pixel proved to be highly variable across scenarios (27-42% and 45-63% respectively, averaged over Europe) and across regions (2.5-86% and 17-86%, averaged over scenarios). Modeled species loss and turnover were found to depend strongly on the degree of change in just two climate variables describing temperature and moisture conditions. Despite the coarse scale of the analysis, species from mountains could be seen to be disproportionably sensitive to climate change (≈60% species loss). The boreal region was projected to lose few species, although gaining many others from immigration. The greatest changes are expected in the transition between the Mediterranean and Euro-Siberian regions. We found that risks of extinction for European plants may be large, even in moderate scenarios of climate change and despite inter-model variability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Thuiller","given":"Wilfried"},{"family":"Lavorel","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Araújo","given":"Miguel B."},{"family":"Sykes","given":"Martin T."},{"family":"Prentice","given":"I.

Even though increasing evidence shows that recent human-induced environmental changes have already triggered species’ range shifts, changes in phenology and species’ extinctions, accurate projections of species’ responses to future environmental changes are more difficult to ascertain. This is problematic, since there is a growing awareness of the need to adopt proactive conservation planning measures using forecasts of species’ responses to future environmental changes. There is a substantial body of literature describing and assessing the impacts of various scenarios of climate and land-use change on species’ distributions. Model predictions include a wide range of assumptions and limitations that are widely acknowledged but compromise their use for developing reliable adaptation and mitigation strategies for biodiversity. Indeed, amongst the most used models, few, if any, explicitly deal with migration processes, the dynamics of population at the “trailing edge” of shifting populations, species’ interactions and the interaction between the effects of climate and land-use. In this review, we propose two main avenues to progress the understanding and prediction of the different processes occurring on the leading and trailing edge of the species’ distribution in response to any global change phenomena. Deliberately focusing on plant species, we first explore the different ways to incorporate species’ migration in the existing modelling approaches, given data and knowledge limitations and the dual effects of climate and land-use factors. Secondly, we explore the mechanisms and processes happening at the trailing edge of a shifting species’ distribution and how to implement them into a modelling approach.

Despite the enthusiasm around these so-called biodiversity models, most approaches are still criticised for not integrating key processes known to shape species ranges and community structure. Developing an integrative modelling framework for biodiversity distribution promises to improve the reliability of predictions and to give a better understanding of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of species and communities under changing environments. In this article, we briefly review some eco-evolutionary processes and interplays among them, which are essential to provide reliable projections of species distributions and community structure. We identify gaps in theory, quantitative knowledge and data availability hampering the development of an integrated modelling framework. We argue that model development relying on a strong theoretical foundation is essential to inspire new models, manage complexity and maintain tractability. We support our argument with an example of a novel integrated model for species distribution modelling, derived from metapopulation theory, which accounts for abiotic constraints, dispersal, biotic interactions and evolution under changing environmental conditions.

Previous theory has considered only the evolution of unconditional dispersal rates, but dispersal is often more complex. For example, many species emigrate in response to crowding. Here, we use an individual-based model to investigate the evolution of density dependent dispersal into empty habitat, such as during an invasion. The landscape is represented as a lattice and dispersal between populations follows a stepping-stone pattern. Individuals carry three ‘genes’ that determine their dispersal strategy when experiencing different population densities. For a stationary range we obtain results consistent with previous theoretical studies: few individuals emigrate from patches that are below equilibrium density. However, during the range expansion of a previously stationary population, we observe evolution towards dispersal strategies where considerable emigration occurs well below equilibrium density. This is true even for moderate costs to dispersal, and always results in accelerating rates of range expansion. Importantly, the evolution we observe at an expanding front depends upon fitness integrated over several generations and cannot be predicted by a consideration of lifetime reproductive success alone. We argue that a better understanding of the role of density dependent dispersal, and its evolution, in driving population dynamics is required especially within the context of range expansions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Travis","given":"Justin M.

Here, a similar modelling approach is taken to establish what determines how species respond to climate change. A similar threshold exists for the rate of climate change as has been observed for habitat loss—patch occupancy remains high up to a critical rate of climate change, beyond which species extinction becomes likely. Habitat specialists, especially those of relatively poor colonizing ability are least able to keep pace with climate change.

Most models of species distribution and spread represent dispersal quite crudely; this chapter begins with some thoughts on how these might be integrated with more sophisticated models of dispersal. The importance of inter-individual variability in dispersal and the role that dispersal evolution may play in range shifting is considered. An example of evolutionary entrapment that arises when species expand their ranges over fragmented landscapes is then presented.

  {"id":"travisDispersalSpeciesResponses2014","abstract":"Dispersal is fundamental in determining biodiversity responses to rapid climate change, but recently acquired ecological and evolutionary knowledge is seldom accounted for in either predictive methods or conservation planning. We emphasise the accumulating evidence for direct and indirect impacts of climate change on dispersal. Additionally, evolutionary theory predicts increases in dispersal at expanding range margins, and this has been observed in a number of species. This multitude of ecological and evolutionary processes is likely to lead to complex responses of dispersal to climate change. As a result, improvement of models of species’ range changes will require greater realism in the representation of dispersal. Placing dispersal at the heart of our thinking will facilitate development of conservation strategies that are resilient to climate change, including landscape management and assisted colonisation. Synthesis This article seeks synthesis across the fields of dispersal ecology and evolution, species distribution modelling and conservation biology. Increasing effort focuses on understanding how dispersal influences species' responses to climate change. Importantly, though perhaps not broadly widely-recognised, species' dispersal characteristics are themselves likely to alter during rapid climate change. We compile evidence for direct and indirect influences that climate change may have on dispersal, some ecological and others evolutionary. We emphasise the need for predictive modelling to account for this dispersal realism and highlight the need for conservation to make better use of our existing knowledge related to dispersal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Travis","given":"J.

  {"id":"travisImprovingPredictionManagement2011a","abstract":"1. Improving the understanding, prediction and management of range expansions is a key challenge for ecology. Over recent years, there has been a rapid increase in modelling effort focussed on range expansions and a shift from predominantly theoretical developments towards application. This is especially the case in the field of invasion biology and also in relation to reintroductions and species’ responses to climate change. 2. While earlier models were exclusively analytical, individual-based models (IBMs) are now increasingly widely used. We argue that instead of being viewed as competing methodologies, analytical and individual-based methods can valuably be used in conjunction. 3. We use a mechanistic wind dispersal model to generate age-specific dispersal kernels for the invasive shrub, Rhododendron ponticum. To demonstrate the utility of employing both modelling approaches, this information along with demographic parameters is incorporated into an IBM and an analytical, integrodifference model. From both models, the equilibrium rate of spread is calculated. 4. Estimates of wavespeeds were similar for the two models, although slower rates of spread were consistently projected by the IBM. Further, our results demonstrate the wavespeed to be sensitive to the characterisation of age structure in the model; when few age classes are used, much higher rates of spread are projected. 5. The analytical model is extremely efficient at providing elasticity analysis of the wavespeed, which can provide helpful information for management. We gain qualitatively similar results using the IBM but obtaining the results is time-consuming and, because the model is stochastic, they are noisy and harder to interpret. We argue that analytically derived transient elasticity analyses are needed for the many cases where success of control is measured on a relatively short time horizon. 6. To demonstrate the flexibility of the IBM approach, we run it on a real landscape comprising different habitat types. The comparison of two different control scenarios is an example of the utility of this approach for more tactical applications. 7. As a general conclusion of the study, we emphasise that analytical and individual-based approaches offer different, but complementary, advantages and suggest how their joint use can facilitate the improvement in biodiversity management at a range of spatial scales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Travis","given":"J.

Despite this, there is a lack of both empirical and theoretical work that examines the behaviour of these populations. Populations living on the edge of a species' range frequently inhabit a more patchily distributed habitat than those that live closer to the centre of the range. This difference is likely to play an important role in determining the dynamics of range margin populations, both when the range is static and when it is dynamic, for example shifting in response to climate change. Here, we present a simple method that simulates the distribution of suitable habitat sites at the edge of a range. Habitat availability is determined as a function of both latitudinal and local environmental variability, and the relative importance of the two can be adjusted. The method is readily extended to describe shifting habitat availability during a period of climate change. We suggest that there is a need for a greater effort to examine the ecology of range margin populations, and believe that the method presented here could be of considerable use in future theoretical studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Travis","given":"J.

  {"id":"travisModellingDispersalEcoevolutionary2012a","abstract":"1. Understanding the causes and consequences of dispersal remains a central topic in ecology and evolution. However, a mismatch exists between our empirical understanding of the complexity of dispersal and our representation of dispersal in models. While the empirical literature is replete with examples of condition dependence at the emigration, movement and settlement phases, models rarely incorporate realism or complexity to this degree. Nor do models often include the different costs associated with dispersal, which can themselves be linked to one or more of the three key phases. 2. Here, we propose that by explicitly accounting for emigration, movement and settlement (and the multiple costs associated with each) we can substantially improve our understanding of both the dispersal process itself and how dispersal traits trade off against other life-history characteristics. We explore some of these issues conceptually, before presenting illustrative results gained from a flexible individual-based model which incorporates considerable dispersal complexity. 3. These results emphasise the nonlinear interplay between the different dispersal stages. For example, we find that investment in movement ability (at a cost to fecundity) depends upon the propensity to emigrate (and vice versa). However, owing to selection acting at the metapopulation level as well as at the individual level, the relationship between the two is not straightforward. Importantly, the shape of the trade-off between movement ability and reproductive potential can strongly influence the joint evolution of dispersal parameters controlling the degree of investment in safer movement, the probability of emigration and the straightness of movement. 4. Our results highlight that the joint evolution of dispersal characteristics can have major implications for spatial population dynamics and we argue that, in addition to increasing our fundamental biological understanding, a new generation of dispersal modelling, which exploits recent empirical advances, can substantially improve our ability to predict and manage the response of species to environmental change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Travis","given":"J.

The visualizations that typically accompany spatially explicit models also permit managers to 'see' the effects of alternative management strategies on populations of interest. However, the expense entailed in developing the data bases required for spatially explicit models may limit widespread implementation. In addition, many of the models are developed for one or a few species, and dealing with multiple species in a landscape remains a significant challenge. To be most useful to land managers, spatially explicit population models should be user friendly, easily portable, operate on spatial and temporal scales appropriate to management decisions, and use input and output variables that can be measured affordably.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Turner","given":"Monica G."},{"family":"Arthaud","given":"Greg J."},{"family":"Engstrom","given":"R.

Most predictions assume simplistic dispersal scenarios and ignore biotic interactions. We argue for incorporating the complexities of dispersal and species interactions.

We show how models using species-specific dispersal can produce more accurate predictions than models applying all-or-nothing dispersal scenarios. Models that additionally include species interactions can generate distinct outcomes. For example, species interactions can slow climate tracking and produce more extinctions than models assuming no interactions. We conclude that (1) just knowing mean dispersal is insufficient to predict biotic responses to climate change, and (2) considering interspecific dispersal variation and species interactions jointly will be necessary to anticipate future changes to biological diversity. We advocate for collecting key information on interspecific dispersal differences and strong biotic interactions so that we can build the more robust predictive models that will be necessary to inform conservation efforts as climates continue to change.","author":[{"family":"Urban","given":"Mark C."},{"family":"Zarnetske","given":"Phoebe L."},{"family":"Skelly","given":"David K."}],"container-title":"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Ann N Y Acad Sci","DOI":"10.1111/nyas.12184","ISSN":"1749-6632","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,9]]},"language":"eng","page":"44-60","PMID":"23819864","source":"PubMed","title":"Moving forward: dispersal and species interactions determine biotic responses to climate change","title-short":"Moving forward","type":"article-journal","volume":"1297"},

In this article, we explore the range of theoretical consequences that result from relaxing this assumption. We show, with a variety of modeling techniques, that matrix quality can be extremely important in determining metapopulation dynamics. A higher-quality matrix generally buffers against extinction. However, in some situations, an increase in matrix quality can generate chaotic subpopulation dynamics, where stability had been the rule in a lower-quality matrix. Furthermore, subpopulations acting as source populations in a low-quality matrix may develop metapopulation dynamics as the quality of the matrix increases. By forcing metapopulation dynamics on a formerly heterogeneous (but stable within subpopulations) population, the probability of simultaneous extinction of all subpopulations actually increases. Thus, it cannot be automatically assumed that increasing matrix quality will lower the probability of global extinction of a population.","author":[{"family":"Vandermeer","given":"J."},{"family":"Carvajal","given":"R."}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"Am Nat","DOI":"10.1086/321318","ISSN":"1537-5323","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,9]]},"language":"eng","page":"211-220","PMID":"18707319","source":"PubMed","title":"Metapopulation dynamics and the quality of the matrix","type":"article-journal","volume":"158"},

To better understand how individuals disperse, it is important to explicitly represent the properties of organisms and the landscape in which they move. A common approach to modelling dispersal includes representing the landscape as a grid of equal sized cells and then simulating individual movement as a correlated random walk. This approach uses a priori scale of resolution, which limits the representation of all landscape features and how different dispersal abilities are modelled. We develop a vector-based landscape model coupled with an object-oriented model for animal dispersal. In this spatially explicit dispersal model, landscape features are defined based on their geographic and thematic properties and dispersal is modelled through consideration of an organism's behavior, movement rules and searching strategies (such as visual cues). We present the model's underlying concepts, its ability to adequately represent landscape features and provide simulation of dispersal according to different dispersal abilities. We demonstrate the potential of the model by simulating two virtual species in a real Swiss landscape. This illustrates the model's ability to simulate complex dispersal processes and provides information about dispersal such as colonization probability and spatial distribution of the organism's path.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Vuilleumier","given":"Séverine"},{"family":"Metzger","given":"Richard"}],"container-title":"Ecological Modelling","container-title-short":"Ecological Modelling","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2005.04.017","ISSN":"0304-3800","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,1,10]]},"language":"en","page":"159-170","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Animal dispersal modelling: Handling landscape features and related animal choices","title-short":"Animal dispersal modelling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438000500222X","volume":"190"},

Using individual-based simulations, we contrast the consequences of three different cognitive strategies on several measures of metapopulation connectivity. Model animals search suitable habitat patches while dispersing through a model landscape made of cells varying in size, shape, attractiveness and friction. In the blind strategy, the next cell is chosen randomly among the adjacent ones. In the near-sighted strategy, the choice depends on the relative attractiveness of these adjacent cells. In the far-sighted strategy, animals may additionally target suitable patches that appear within their perceptual range. Simulations show that the blind strategy provides the best overall connectivity, and results in balanced dispersal. The near-sighted strategy traps animals into corridors that reduce the number of potential targets, thereby fragmenting metapopulations in several local clusters of demes, and inducing sink-source dynamics. This sort of local trapping is somewhat prevented in the far-sighted strategy. The colonization success of strategies depends highly on initial energy reserves: blind does best when energy is high, near-sighted wins at intermediate levels, and far-sighted outcompetes its rivals at low energy reserves. We also expect strong effects in terms of metapopulation genetics: the blind strategy generates a migrant-pool mode of dispersal that should erase local structures. By contrast, near- and far-sighted strategies generate a propagule-pool mode of dispersal and source-sink behavior that should boost structures (high genetic variance among-and low variance within local clusters of demes), particularly if metapopulation dynamics is also affected by extinction-colonization processes. Our results thus point to important effects of the cognitive ability of dispersers on the connectivity, dynamics and genetics of metapopulations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Vuilleumier","given":"Séverine"},{"family":"Perrin","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Ranta","given":"Esa"}],"container-title":"Oikos","ISSN":"0030-1299","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"page":"139-147","publisher":"[Nordic Society Oikos, Wiley]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Effects of Cognitive Abilities on Metapopulation Connectivity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3548543","volume":"113"},

The methods included replicated mark-release-recapture (MRR) experiments conducted in the natural environments in China and Finland, tracking with harmonic radar of captive-reared but free-flying butterflies in a common environment in the field, and replicated common garden experiments in a large outdoor population cage. 4. The results were largely consistent, showing that butterflies from the more continuous landscape in China had a lower movement rate than butterflies originating from the fragmented landscape in Finland. Butterflies originating from newly-established populations in Finland moved significantly longer distances than butterflies originating from old populations in Finland or from China, demonstrating significant intra-specific variation in dispersal rate in Finland. These results are consistent with model predictions for the Glanville fritillary. 5. The tracking experiment revealed a result that would have been impossible to obtain with MRR experiments: movement rate was influenced by a significant interaction between population origin (China vs. Finland) and ambient air temperature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Rongjiang"},{"family":"Ovaskainen","given":"Otso"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Yundong"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Houqiang"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Chongren"},{"family":"Hanski","given":"Ilkka"}],"container-title":"Ecological Entomology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2311.2011.01267.x","ISSN":"1365-2311","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2011.01267.x","page":"251-260","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Dispersal in the Glanville fritillary butterfly in fragmented versus continuous landscapes: comparison between three methods","title-short":"Dispersal in the Glanville fritillary butterfly in fragmented versus continuous landscapes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2011.01267.x","volume":"36"},

Here we evaluated changes in the distribution sizes and abundances of 46 species of butterflies that approach their northern climatic range margins in Britain—where changes in climate and habitat are opposing forces. These insects might be expected to have responded positively to climate warming over the past 30 years, yet three-quarters of them declined: negative responses to habitat loss have outweighed positive responses to climate warming. Half of the species that were mobile and habitat generalists increased their distribution sites over this period (consistent with a climate explanation), whereas the other generalists and 89% of the habitat specialists declined in distribution size (consistent with habitat limitation). Changes in population abundances closely matched changes in distributions. The dual forces of habitat modification and climate change are likely to cause specialists to decline, leaving biological communities with reduced numbers of species and dominated by mobile and widespread habitat generalists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Warren","given":"M.

Conservation strategies increasingly incorporate measures to combat fragmentation such as ecological networks. These are often based on assessment of landscape structure but such approaches fail to capitalise on the potential offered by more ecologically robust assessments of landscape function and connectivity. In this paper, we describe a modelling approach to identifying functional habitat networks and demonstrate its application to a fragmented landscape where policy initiatives seek to improve conditions for woodland biodiversity including increasing woodland cover. Functional habitat networks were defined by identifying suitable habitat and by modelling connectivity using least-cost approaches to account for matrix permeability. Generic focal species (GFS) profiles were developed, in consultation with stakeholders, to represent species with high and moderate sensitivity to fragmentation. We demonstrated how this form of analysis can be used to aid the spatial targeting of conservation actions. This ‘targeted’ action scenario was tested for effectiveness against comparable scenarios, which were based on random and clumped actions within the same landscape. We tested effectiveness using structural metrics, network-based metrics and a published functional connectivity indicator. Targeting actions within networks resulted in the highest mean woodland area and highest connectivity indicator value. Our approach provides an assessment of landscape function by recognising the importance of the landscape matrix. It provides a framework for the targeting and evaluation of alternative conservation options, offering a pragmatic, ecologically-robust solution to a current need in applied landscape ecology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Watts","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Eycott","given":"Amy E."},{"family":"Handley","given":"Phillip"},{"family":"Ray","given":"Duncan"},{"family":"Humphrey","given":"Jonathan W."},{"family":"Quine","given":"Christopher P."}],"container-title":"Landscape Ecology","container-title-short":"Landscape Ecol","DOI":"10.1007/s10980-010-9507-9","ISSN":"1572-9761","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1305-1318","source":"Springer Link","title":"Targeting and evaluating biodiversity conservation action within fragmented landscapes: an approach based on generic focal species and least-cost networks","title-short":"Targeting and evaluating biodiversity conservation action within fragmented landscapes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-010-9507-9","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"wiegandEffectsHabitatLoss2005","abstract":"We used a spatially explicit population model that was generalized to produce nine ecological profiles of long-lived species with stable home ranges and natal dispersal to investigate the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on population dynamics. We simulated population dynamics in landscapes composed of three habitat types (good-quality habitat ranging from 10-25%, poor-quality habitat ranging from 10-70%, and matrix). Landscape structures varied from highly fragmented to completely contiguous. The specific aims of our model were (1) to investigate under which biological circumstances the traditional approach of using two types only (habitat and matrix) failed and assess the potential impact of restoring matrix to poor-quality habitat, (2) to investigate how much of the variation in population size was explained by landscape composition alone and which key attributes of landscape structure can serve as predictors of population response, and (3) to estimate the maximum fragmentation effects expressed in equivalent pure loss of good-quality habitat. Poor-quality habitat mattered most in situations when it was generally not considered (i.e., for metapopulations or spatially structured populations when it provides dispersal habitat). Population size increased up to 3 times after restoring matrix to poor-quality habitat. Overall, habitat amount accounted for 68%) of the variation in population size, whereas ecological profile and fragmentation accounted for approximately 13%> each. The maximal effect of (good-quality) habitat fragmentation was equivalent to a pure loss of up to 15%> of good-quality habitat, and the maximal loss of individuals resulting from maximal fragmentation reached 80%. Abundant dispersal habitat and sufficiently large dispersal potential, however, resulted in functionally connected landscapes, and maximal fragmentation had no effect at all. Our findings suggest that predicting fragmentation effects requires a good understanding of the biology and habitat use of the species in question and that the uniqueness of species and the landscapes in which they live confound simple analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Wiegand","given":"Thorsten"},{"family":"Revilla","given":"Eloy"},{"family":"Moloney","given":"Kirk A."}],"container-title":"Conservation Biology","ISSN":"0888-8892","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"page":"108-121","publisher":"[Wiley, Society for Conservation Biology]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Effects of Habitat Loss and Fragmentation on Population Dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3591014","volume":"19"},

An inability to spread into new areas may result in large reductions in species’ ranges in the future, and threaten the survival of some species. Here we use “species-climate” models to predict suitable sites for introductions beyond current range margins, using two U.K. butterfly species. We introduced Melanargia galathea (marbled white) and Thymelicus sylvestris (small skipper) into two sites in northern England, ∼65 and ∼35 km beyond their then-range margins, respectively, to sites that were predicted to be climatically suitable and that appeared to contain suitable habitat for the species. Both introduced populations grew and expanded their range over 6 years (2001–2006; still thriving in 2008), suggesting the existence of a colonization lag and providing evidence that well-planned assisted colonization can be successful.

Here we use a dynamic model framework to demonstrate that recently-observed changes at the expanding northern boundaries of three British butterfly species can be predicted with good accuracy. Previous work established that the distributions of the study species currently lag behind climate change, and so we presumed that climate is not currently a major constraint at the northern range margins of our study species. We predicted 1970–2000 distribution changes using a colonisation model, MIGRATE, superimposed on a high-resolution map of habitat availability. Thirty-year rates and patterns of distribution change could be accurately predicted for each species (κ goodness-of-fit of models >0.64 for all three species, corresponding to >83% of grid cells correctly assigned), using a combination of individual species traits, species-specific habitat associations and distance-dependent dispersal. Sensitivity analyses showed that population productivity was the most important determinant of the rate of distribution expansion (variation in dispersal rate was not studied because the species are thought to be similar in dispersal capacity), and that each species’ distribution prior to expansion was critical in determining the spatial pattern of the current distribution. In future, modelling approaches that combine climate suitability and spatially-explicit population models, incorporating demographic variables and habitat availability, are likely to be valuable tools in projecting species’ responses to climatic change and hence in anticipating management to facilitate species’ dispersal and persistence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Willis","given":"Stephen G."},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Chris D."},{"family":"Hill","given":"Jane K."},{"family":"Collingham","given":"Yvonne C."},{"family":"Telfer","given":"Mark G."},{"family":"Fox","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Huntley","given":"Brian"}],"container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0587.2008.05711.x","ISSN":"1600-0587","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2008.05711.x","page":"5-12","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Dynamic distribution modelling: predicting the present from the past","title-short":"Dynamic distribution modelling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2008.05711.x","volume":"32"},
  {"id":"wiszRoleBioticInteractions2013","abstract":"Predicting which species will occur together in the future, and where, remains one of the greatest challenges in ecology, and requires a sound understanding of how the abiotic and biotic environments interact with dispersal processes and history across scales. Biotic interactions and their dynamics influence species' relationships to climate, and this also has important implications for predicting future distributions of species. It is already well accepted that biotic interactions shape species' spatial distributions at local spatial extents, but the role of these interactions beyond local extents (e.g. 10 km(2)  to global extents) are usually dismissed as unimportant. In this review we consolidate evidence for how biotic interactions shape species distributions beyond local extents and review methods for integrating biotic interactions into species distribution modelling tools. Drawing upon evidence from contemporary and palaeoecological studies of individual species ranges, functional groups, and species richness patterns, we show that biotic interactions have clearly left their mark on species distributions and realised assemblages of species across all spatial extents. We demonstrate this with examples from within and across trophic groups. A range of species distribution modelling tools is available to quantify species environmental relationships and predict species occurrence, such as: (i) integrating pairwise dependencies, (ii) using integrative predictors, and (iii) hybridising species distribution models (SDMs) with dynamic models. These methods have typically only been applied to interacting pairs of species at a single time, require a priori ecological knowledge about which species interact, and due to data paucity must assume that biotic interactions are constant in space and time. To better inform the future development of these models across spatial scales, we call for accelerated collection of spatially and temporally explicit species data. Ideally, these data should be sampled to reflect variation in the underlying environment across large spatial extents, and at fine spatial resolution. Simplified ecosystems where there are relatively few interacting species and sometimes a wealth of existing ecosystem monitoring data (e.g. arctic, alpine or island habitats) offer settings where the development of modelling tools that account for biotic interactions may be less difficult than elsewhere.","author":[{"family":"Wisz","given":"Mary Susanne"},{"family":"Pottier","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Kissling","given":"W.

  {"id":"withApplicationNeutralLandscape1997","abstract":"Neutral landscape models, derived from percolation theory in the field of landscape ecology, are grid-based maps in which complex habitat distributions are generated by random or fractal algorithms. This grid-based representation of landscape structure is compatible with the raster-based format of geographical information systems (GIS), which facilitates comparisons between theoretical and real landscapes. Neutral landscape models permit the identification of critical thresholds in connectivity, which can be used to predict when landscapes will become fragmented. The coupling of neutral landscape models with generalized population models, such as metapopulation theory, provides a null model for generating predictions about population dynamics in fragmented landscapes. Neutral landscape models can contribute to the following applications in conservation: (1) incorporation of complex spatial patterns in (meta)population models; (2) identification of species' perceptions of landscape structure; (3) determination of landscape connectivity; (4) evaluation of the consequences of habitat fragmentation for population subdivision; (5) identification of the domain of metapopulation dynamics; (6) prediction of the occurrence of extinction thresholds; (7) determination of the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation; and (8) reserve design and ecosystem management. This generalized, spatially explicit framework bridges the gap between spatially implicit, patch-based models and spatially realistic GIS applications which are usually parameterized for a single species in a specific landscape.

  {"id":"withExtinctionThresholdsSpecies1999","abstract":"Abstract: Predicting species’ responses to habitat loss and fragmentation is one of the greatest challenges facing conservation biologists, particularly if extinction is a threshold phenomenon. Extinction thresholds are abrupt declines in the patch occupancy of a metapopulation across a narrow range of habitat loss. Metapopulation-type models have been used to predict extinction thresholds for endangered populations. These models often make simplifying assumptions about the distribution of habitat (random) and the search for suitable habitat sites (random dispersal). We relaxed these two assumptions in a modeling approach that combines a metapopulation model with neutral landscape models of fractal habitat distributions. Dispersal success for suitable, unoccupied sites was higher on fractal landscapes for nearest-neighbor dispersers (moving through adjacent cells of the landscape) than for dispersers searching at random (random distance and direction between steps) on random landscapes. Consequently, species either did not suffer extinction thresholds or extinction thresholds occurred later, at lower levels of habitat abundance, than predicted previously. The exception is for species with limited demographic potential, owing to low reproductive output , in which extinction thresholds occurred sooner than on random landscapes in all but the most clumped fractal landscapes . Furthermore, the threshold was more precipitous for these species. Many species of conservation concern have limited demographic potential, and these species may be at greater risk from habitat loss and fragmentation than previously suspected.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"With","given":"Kimberly A."},{"family":"King","given":"Anthony W."}],"container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1046/j.1523-1739.1999.013002314.x","ISSN":"1523-1739","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1999.013002314.x","page":"314-326","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Extinction Thresholds for Species in Fractal Landscapes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1999.013002314.x","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"zhengModellingDispersalDiffusion2009a","abstract":"Quantifying dispersal is crucial both for understanding ecological population dynamics, and for gaining insight into factors that affect the genetic structure of populations. The role of dispersal becomes pronounced in highly fragmented landscapes inhabited by spatially structured populations. We consider a landscape consisting of a set of habitat patches surrounded by unsuitable matrix, and model dispersal by assuming that the individuals follow a random walk with parameters that may be specific to the habitat type. We allow for spatial variation in patch quality, and account for edge-mediated behavior, the latter meaning that the individuals bias their movement towards the patches when close to an edge between a patch and the matrix. We employ a diffusion approximation of the random walk model to derive analytical expressions for various characteristics of the dispersal process. For example, we derive formulae for the time that an individual is expected to spend in its current patch i, and for the time that it will spend in the matrix, both conditional on the individual hitting next a given patch j before hitting any of the other patches or dying. The analytical formulae are based on the assumptions that the landscape is infinitely large, that the patches are circularly shaped, and that the patches are small compared to interpatch distances. We evaluate the effect of these assumptions by comparing the analytical results to numerical results in a real patch network that violates all of the three assumptions. We then consider a landscape that fulfills the assumptions, and show that in this case the analytical results are in a very good agreement with the numerical results. The results obtained here allow the construction of computationally efficient dispersal models that can be used as components of metapopulation models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Zheng","given":"Chaozhi"},{"family":"Pennanen","given":"Juho"},{"family":"Ovaskainen","given":"Otso"}],"container-title":"Ecological Modelling","container-title-short":"Ecological Modelling","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2009.02.024","ISSN":"0304-3800","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,6,24]]},"language":"en","page":"1495-1505","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Modelling dispersal with diffusion and habitat selection: Analytical results for highly fragmented landscapes","title-short":"Modelling dispersal with diffusion and habitat selection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380009001203","volume":"220"},

We have constructed an individual-based evolutionary sexual model of dispersal for species occurring as metapopulations in habitat patch networks. The model assumes correlated random walk dispersal with edge-mediated behaviour (habitat selection) and spatially correlated stochastic local dynamics. The model is parametrized with extensive data for the Glanville fritillary butterfly. Based on empirical results for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi) gene, we assume that dispersal rate in the landscape matrix, fecundity and survival are affected by a locus with two alleles, A and C, individuals with the C allele being more mobile. The model was successfully tested with two independent empirical datasets on spatial variation in Pgi allele frequency. First, at the level of local populations, the frequency of the C allele is the highest in newly established isolated populations and the lowest in old isolated populations. Second, at the level of sub-networks with dissimilar numbers and connectivities of patches, the frequency of C increases with decreasing network size and hence with decreasing average metapopulation size. The frequency of C is the highest in landscapes where local extinction risk is high and where there are abundant opportunities to establish new populations. Our results indicate that the strength of the coupling of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics depends on the spatial scale and is asymmetric, demographic dynamics having a greater immediate impact on genetic dynamics than vice versa.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Zheng","given":"Chaozhi"},{"family":"Ovaskainen","given":"Otso"},{"family":"Hanski","given":"Ilkka"}],"container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2009.0005","ISSN":"0962-8436","issue":"1523","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,6,12]]},"page":"1519-1532","PMCID":"PMC2690501","PMID":"19414467","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Modelling single nucleotide effects in phosphoglucose isomerase on dispersal in the Glanville fritillary butterfly: coupling of ecological and evolutionary dynamics","title-short":"Modelling single nucleotide effects in phosphoglucose isomerase on dispersal in the Glanville fritillary butterfly","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690501/","volume":"364"},

To this end, we developed computer simulations that contrast the effectiveness of various search strategies at finding habitat patches in idealized landscapes (uniform, random, or clumped patches), where searchers have different energy reserves and face different mortality risks. Nearly straight correlated random walks always produced better dispersal success than relatively uncorrelated random walks. However, increasing patch density decreased the degree of correlation that maximized dispersal success. Only under high mortality and low energy reserves in a uniform landscape did absolutely straight-line search perform better than any random walk. With low mortality risks and high energy reserves, exhaustive systematic search was superior to the best correlated random walk; an increase in the perceptual range of the searcher (i.e., patch detectability) also favored exhaustive search over relatively straight random walks. For all conditions examined, the “average distance rule,” a hybrid search rule incorporating both straight-line and systematic search, was best. Overall, however, our results suggest that a simple and effective search rule for many landscape-explicit models would involve straight or nearly straight movements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Zollner","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Lima","given":"Steven L."}],"container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[1019:SSFLLI]2.0.CO;2","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1890/0012-9658%281999%29080%5B1019%3ASSFLLI%5D2.0.CO%3B2","page":"1019-1030","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Search Strategies for Landscape-Level Interpatch Movements","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/0012-9658%281999%29080%5B1019%3ASSFLLI%5D2.0.CO%3B2","volume":"80"},

  {"id":"zurellStaticSpeciesDistribution2009","abstract":"It is widely acknowledged that species respond to climate change by range shifts. Robust predictions of such changes in species’ distributions are pivotal for conservation planning and policy making, and are thus major challenges in ecological research. Statistical species distribution models (SDMs) have been widely applied in this context, though they remain subject to criticism as they implicitly assume equilibrium, and incorporate neither dispersal, demographic processes nor biotic interactions explicitly. In this study, the effects of transient dynamics and ecological properties and processes on the prediction accuracy of SDMs for climate change projections were tested. A spatially explicit multi-species dynamic population model was built, incorporating species-specific and interspecific ecological processes, environmental stochasticity and climate change. Species distributions were sampled in different scenarios, and SDMs were estimated by applying generalised linear models (GLMs) and boosted regression trees (BRTs). Resulting model performances were related to prevailing ecological processes and temporal dynamics. SDM performance varied for different range dynamics. Prediction accuracies decreased when abrupt range shifts occurred as species were outpaced by the rate of climate change, and increased again when a new equilibrium situation was realised. When ranges contracted, prediction accuracies increased as the absences were predicted well. Far-dispersing species were faster in tracking climate change, and were predicted more accurately by SDMs than short-dispersing species. BRTs mostly outperformed GLMs. The presence of a predator, and the inclusion of its incidence as an environmental predictor, made BRTs and GLMs perform similarly. Results are discussed in light of other studies dealing with effects of ecological traits and processes on SDM performance. Perspectives are given on further advancements of SDMs and for possible interfaces with more mechanistic approaches in order to improve predictions under environmental change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Zurell","given":"Damaris"},{"family":"Jeltsch","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Dormann","given":"Carsten F."},{"family":"Schröder","given":"Boris"}],"container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.05810.x","ISSN":"1600-0587","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.05810.x","page":"733-744","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Static species distribution models in dynamically changing systems: how good can predictions really be?","title-short":"Static species distribution models in dynamically changing systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.05810.x","volume":"32"},
  {"id":"zurellUncertaintyPredictionsRange2012a","abstract":"Empirical species distribution models (SDMs) constitute often the tool of choice for the assessment of rapid climate change effects on species’ vulnerability. Conclusions regarding extinction risks might be misleading, however, because SDMs do not explicitly incorporate dispersal or other demographic processes. Here, we supplement SDMs with a dynamic population model 1) to predict climate‐induced range dynamics for black grouse in Switzerland, 2) to compare direct and indirect measures of extinction risks, and 3) to quantify uncertainty in predictions as well as the sources of that uncertainty. To this end, we linked models of habitat suitability to a spatially explicit, individual‐based model. In an extensive sensitivity analysis, we quantified uncertainty in various model outputs introduced by different SDM algorithms, by different climate scenarios and by demographic model parameters. Potentially suitable habitats were predicted to shift uphill and eastwards. By the end of the 21st century, abrupt habitat losses were predicted in the western Prealps for some climate scenarios. In contrast, population size and occupied area were primarily controlled by currently negative population growth and gradually declined from the beginning of the century across all climate scenarios and SDM algorithms. However, predictions of population dynamic features were highly variable across simulations. Results indicate that inferring extinction probabilities simply from the quantity of suitable habitat may underestimate extinction risks because this may ignore important interactions between life history traits and available habitat. Also, in dynamic range predictions uncertainty in SDM algorithms and climate scenarios can become secondary to uncertainty in dynamic model components. Our study emphasises the need for principal evaluation tools like sensitivity analysis in order to assess uncertainty and robustness in dynamic range predictions. A more direct benefit of such robustness analysis is an improved mechanistic understanding of dynamic species’ responses to climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Zurell","given":"Damaris"},{"family":"Grimm","given":"Volker"},{"family":"Rossmanith","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Zbinden","given":"Niklaus"},{"family":"Zimmermann","given":"Niklaus E."},{"family":"Schröder","given":"Boris"}],"ISSN":"0906-7590","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","source":"pubag.nal.usda.gov","title":"Uncertainty in predictions of range dynamics: black grouse climbing the Swiss Alps","title-short":"Uncertainty in predictions of range dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/517524"}
