RangeShifter v2.0 Patch

Implements the class: Patch

A patch is a collection of one or more Cells in the the gridded Landscape,
which together provide the area in which a single demographic unit of a Species,
i.e. a Population, can reproduce. One or more Populations (of different Species)
form a Sub-community associated with the Patch.

There is no requirement that all the Cells be adjacent, although in practice
that would usually be the case.

Each Patch must have a unique positive integer id number supplied by the user,
and the matrix, i.e. any part of the landscape which is not a breeding patch,
is represented by Patch 0. However, as patch numbers need not be sequential,
an internal sequential number is also applied.

For a 'cell-based model', the user supplies no patch numbers, and a separate
Patch is generated internally for each Cell, i.e. the 'cell-based model' is a
special case of the 'patch-based model' in which each Patch has a single Cell.
Moreover, there is also the 'matrix' Patch 0, which has no cells, but which
holds the disperser population whilst its Individuals are in transit.

In a true patch-based model, each Patch hold a list of its constituent Cells,
EXCEPT for the matrix Patch 0. This is because that list would be extremely
long for a very large landscape in which suitable patches are small and/or rare,
and removing Cells from it if the landscape is dynamic would be inefficient.
