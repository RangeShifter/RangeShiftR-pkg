# RangeShifter core code 

This repo contains the core simulation code for RangeShifter v2.0 and is not meant to be compiled or run on its own.

If you are only interested in using RangeShifter, you can ignore this and head to the repo of one of the interfaces:

- [WIP] RangeShifter GUI

- [RangeShiftR](https://github.com/RangeShifter/RangeShiftR-pkg)

- [RangeShifter-batch](https://github.com/RangeShifter/RangeShifter_batch)

## Usage: git subtree

In order to ensure that the same version of RangeShifter's core code is used by all three interfaces (RangeShiftR, RangeShifter-batch and the GUI), each interface repo keeps a copy of RScore as a git subtree. In this section, we describe how to use the git subtrees to update the subfolder and copy this repo anew.

First, in a local clone of one of the interface repos, add a remote named `RScore` pointing to the RScore repo. This will be convenient as a shortcut for git subtree commands.

```bash
git remote add RScore https://github.com/RangeShifter/RScore.git
```

### Pulling new changes

To update the RScore subfolder with new changes made to the RScore repo, one can use the `git subtree pull` command:

```bash
git subtree pull --prefix <path_to_RScore_subfolder> RScore <branch>
```

Note the path must match the location of the RScore subfolder, and the branch must match the one the subtree was originally added from (by default, this should be `main`).

e.g. for RangeShifter-batch, use:

```bash
git subtree pull --prefix src/RScore RScore main
```

while for RangeShiftR, use:

```bash
git subtree pull --prefix RangeShiftR/src/RScore RScore main
```

### Pushing new changes to RScore

We haven't yet found a way to push new changes made in a RScore subfolder back into the RScore repo. This is why we ask that contributions are made directly inside the RScore repo.

If you know how to do this, please drop us a line!

Alternatively, if you have already made changes on the subfolder, you could copy its contents into a new branch in RScore, then open a pull request.

### Switching the subfolder to a new branch

There is unfortunately to do so. To track a different branch of RScore, one must delete the RScore subfolder (via git) and import the subtree again:

```bash
git rm src/RScore -r
git commit -m "switching subtree branch"
git subtree add --prefix src/RScore RScore <the new branch>
```
